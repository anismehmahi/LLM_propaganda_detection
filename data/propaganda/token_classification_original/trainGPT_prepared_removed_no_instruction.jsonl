{"prompt":"Vote targeting Jewish student politician was not anti-Semitic: McGill report\n\nMONTREAL – It was political disagreement — not anti-Semitism — that led to a Jewish student being voted off the McGill University student council’s board of directors, an investigation ordered by the principal has concluded.\nBut Jewish groups on and off campus have denounced the report as flawed, saying it missed the significance of an anti-Semitic text circulated online before Noah Lew was removed from the board last fall.\nA joint statement from five campus Jewish groups says the report, released this week by principal Suzanne Fortier, “appears to condone discrimination against Jewish students at McGill based on the cultural and religious organizations they affiliate with.”\nThe controversy has its roots in McGill’s long-running debate over the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.\nAt an Oct. 23 general assembly of the Student Society of McGill University, a routine motion to elect a slate of directors turned contentious.\nSupporters of a group called Democratize SSMU, formed to fight a decision of the board of directors declaring BDS counter to the SSMU constitution, brought a motion to divide the election vote.\nIn the past they had been ratified as a bloc.\nThe first five candidates were overwhelmingly approved, but when they got to Lew, the only Jewish director, he was rejected 105 to 73.\nIn a subsequent Facebook post, Lew wrote, “My Jewish identity was now public, and a target was placed squarely upon me by the McGill BDS movement.”\nAn outcry followed, leading Fortier to appoint former Ombudsperson for Students, Spencer Boudreau, to investigate.\nShe also created a Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life and a support line to report incidents of intolerance.\nBoudreau interviewed 38 students over his three-and-a-half week investigation.\nHis findings, he wrote, do “not substantiate the notion that the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism,” which he defined as hostility toward or discrimination against Jews.\nRather, he found, votes against Lew were “motivated by politics, that is, based on his support for Israel and Zionism and\/or for his view of the BDS movement.” Protests about Israel’s policies cannot be equated with anti-Semitism, Boudreau wrote, though he said Lew’s belief that he was targeted because he was Jewish was “honest and even understandable.”\nA statement Wednesday by Hillel McGill, Chabad at McGill and three other Jewish groups said Boudreau was mistaken about the timing of an anti-Semitic message posted online by Democratize SSMU.\nBoudreau’s report said the message followed the assembly vote, but in fact it was posted at the beginning of October.\nDemocratize SSMU deleted the message, which targeted Lew and two other candidates, after the meeting and apologized for publishing material that was “insensitive to anti-Semitic tropes of Jewish people as corrupt and politically powerful.”\nThe Jewish groups said this anti-Semitic rhetoric “was used to encourage students to vote specifically against Noah Lew.\nIt is under this context that the (general assembly) occurred, and the report fundamentally misunderstands this, which alters the entire findings of the report.”\nThey say Boudreau’s report “insinuates that Jewish students who engage with mainstream Jewish community organizations are permitted to be precluded from holding political office.”\nLew was restored to his post as a director last month after a ruling that the split vote in October had violated the SSMU constitution.\nHe was not immediately available for comment.\nMichael Mostyn, CEO of B’nai Brith Canada, called the report a whitewash.\n“The report does not present a full or accurate picture of the hostile atmosphere facing Jewish students at McGill,” he said in a statement.\nFortier said the university’s next actions will be based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life, due to report in April.\n“I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that there is absolutely no place for anti-Semitism at McGill University and that, as principal and vice-chancellor, I will remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe, welcomed and respected on our campuses,” she said in a statement.\n• Email: ghamilton@nationalpost.com | Twitter: grayhamilton\n>","completion":" Doubt|303|504\nLoaded_Language|1489|1525\nCausal_Oversimplification|1450|1552\nLoaded_Language|1555|1564\nName_Calling,Labeling|2878|2914\nDoubt|2953|3233\nExaggeration,Minimisation|4046|4083\nLoaded_Language|1303|1326\nName_Calling,Labeling|3659|3670."}

{"prompt":"British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too\n\nThe Guardian reported Thursday that “Chris Bryant, a senior Labour backbencher,” has written to British prime minister Theresa May, urging her to “issue an official ban on Donald Trump from entering the UK on the grounds he is condoning fascism and his presence is ‘not conducive to the public good.'”\nWhen Western historians look back at the 21st century, the Geller-Spencer ban in the U.K. will be viewed as one of that once great nation’s darkest moments and a low point for freedom.\nIt was the victory of Islamic law over Western law, sharia over freedom.\nThis because Trump retweeted three videos showing Muslims being violent.\nBryant, a former Foreign Office minister, supported this madness by pointing to…me.\nHe cited the cases of two U.S. far-right bloggers, Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, who were banned by May in 2013 from entering the U.K.\nI was going to be among a group of freedom-fighters – a true rainbow coalition of human rights activists from all over the world (a Hindu princess had been set to join us) – to honor the memory of Lee Rigby, the British soldier who had been murdered on a London street in broad daylight by an Islamic jihadist on May 22, 2013.\nWe planned to pay our respects to Lee Rigby by placing a wreath at his memorial, in his memory and in memory of his service.\nWe planned to bring the Stars and Stripes, as well as British and Danish flags, and participate in Armed Forces Day memorial commemorations at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, where Rigby served.\nFor this, we were banned.\nWhen Prime Minister Theresa May, who was the head of the Home Office when she banned us and was thus directly responsible for the ban, threw us under the bus in order to satiate savages who threatened violence, did she really think she or anyone would be safe?\nSafe by surrender?\nWhen did they ever work in the history of humankind?\nThe über-left pol citing the Geller-Spencer ban in the U.K. to ban Trump was inevitable.\nIt’s like the Geller ban on ads on buses and subways in every major American city: the Catholic Church just tried to run ads on buses in Washington, D.C., and discovered that it couldn’t because of the ban on all political ads that was enacted in order to prevent my ads from running.\nOnce you sanction the silencing and persecution of one, inevitably, you’ve sanctioned it for all.\nIt’s open season on the opposition.\nWho decides what’s good and what’s forbidden in a totalitarian society?\nThe totalitarians.\nThe worldwide howl at Trump’s retweets of videos tweeted out by a British politician is further proof of the Islamization of the West.\nIt speaks to how deeply and far and widely sharia has been normed and accepted by Western elites.\nThe videos in the retweets are authentic and have circulated for years.\nThey’re neither “far-right” nor “Islamophobic”; they’re just factual.\nOnce again the media are blaming the messenger instead of dealing with Islamic violence.\nTrump didn’t add any rhetoric to his tweets.\nHe retweeted authentic videos.\n(The Dutch media now claim that one of them doesn’t depict Muslim migrants being violent, as was claimed.\nEven if this is true, Muslim migrant violence is a grim and increasingly common reality in Europe.)\nIf Muslims sincerely condemn jihad terror and sharia oppression, they shouldn’t oppose him.\nIn a letter to May, Bryant wrote: “I am writing to you to ask you and the home secretary to take immediate action to ban the president of the United States, Donald Trump, from entering the United Kingdom, due to his apparent support for far-right groups in this country.\nIn retweeting Jayda Fransen’s posts, it is absolutely clear to me that President Trump is supporting and condoning fascism and far-right activity.\nThis activity has frequently taken the form of violence on our streets.\nMs Fransen herself has a long history of racism and Islamophobia, some of it criminal.\nMany of the people you have rightly banned from entering the UK were guilty of less than this.”\n“Fascism.” By that Bryant means “defending British values.”\nWhile admitting numerous jihad preachers, Britain is keeping out the voices of sanity that would call that nation back to a path that would secure freedom for her children and her children’s children instead of a path to national suicide.\nAnd now a call to ban the president of the nation that saved their nation from extinction not 70 years ago.\nThe full story of my being banned from the UK for standing against jihad, and much more, is in my new book, FATWA: Hunted in America .\nGet the book.\nBuy it for friends.\nEducate those around you.\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller\n>","completion":" Doubt|1822|1871\nDoubt|1872|1943\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|2918|3005\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|293|373\nLoaded_Language|494|557\nLoaded_Language|566|630\nLoaded_Language|757|769\nLoaded_Language|982|1032\nCausal_Oversimplification|2543|2676\nLoaded_Language|3240|3276\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|3289|3379\nFlag-Waving|4087|4113\nLoaded_Language|4179|4199\nFlag-Waving|4211|4351."}

{"prompt":"The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh\n\nTwo more women accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh of dubious improprieties materialized out of thin air late Sunday, throwing Senate Republicans’ hope of finally confirming the Supreme Court nominee this week even more into doubt.\nThe new allegations came yesterday amid reports that Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tentatively scheduled a hearing for this Thursday to take testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, sexually assaulted her decades ago when he was a high school student.\nSuspiciously, Ford can’t –or won’t— say when or where the alleged incident happened and can provide few details.\nAs Paul Sperry writes at the New York Post, working with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and backed financially by George Soros’s money, Ford’s lawyers spent the last few days gaming the system.\nAfter stalling Grassley and getting repeated extensions, the attorneys got the chairman to cave on various demands, such as that Kavanaugh not be in the room when Ford gives evidence.\nRepublicans never seem to learn from their mistakes.\nAs usual, Republicans’ seeming reasonableness is rewarded with more abuse by the Left.\nGive left-wingers an inch and they’ll take a mile.\nDemocrats, it turns out, used the extra time created through their delaying tactics to produce two new women with questionable claims against Kavanaugh.\nMore accusers could be on their way.\nPresident Trump continues to support Kavanaugh, who maintains his innocence.\n“This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,” the nominee said Sunday of Ford’s accusations.\n“The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so.\nThis is a smear, plain and simple.\nI look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name — and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building — against these last-minute allegations.”\nIf Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench on October 1, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.\nThe high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have only been only eight justices in place.\nRoughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.\nDemocrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they stand a good chance of taking control from Republicans.\nElection Day is November 6.\nThe GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.\nMeanwhile, the New Yorker magazine reported Sunday that Deborah Ramirez, 53, suddenly claims to have been assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College.\nRamirez claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.\nAlso on Sunday, media-savvy sleazeball lawyer Michael Avenatti, who represents porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted that he represents another woman who plans to accuse Kavanaugh of something.\n“I represent a woman with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh and Mark Judge.\nWe will be demanding the opportunity to present testimony to the committee and will likewise be demanding that Judge and others be subpoenaed to testify,” Avenatti wrote on Twitter.\n“My client is not Deborah Ramirez.”\nWashington insiders still believe Kavanaugh will be confirmed, or at least they did before the two new accusers popped up.\nFor example, at a Friday afternoon preview of upcoming cases in the Supreme Court’s approaching October term that was hosted by the Federalist Society, panelist Thomas C. Goldstein of the law firm of Goldstein & Russell predicted that the high court would have nine members again soon.\n“There is exactly a zero percent chance that [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley will allow this thing to get past the lame-duck” congressional session after Election Day, said the co-founder of SCOTUSblog who has appeared before the Supreme Court many times.\n“I think we ought to recognize that.\nThe prospect that the Democrats will take the Senate, albeit thin, is realistic, and so they will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure that there is a ninth member of the court there by the time a Democratic majority could take over in the Senate in January.”\nWe’ll see soon enough if Goldstein’s prediction comes true.\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|4|21\nLoaded_Language|108|136\nDoubt|573|684\nLoaded_Language|863|880\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1206|1255\nName_Calling,Labeling|1211|1223\nLoaded_Language|1714|1719\nName_Calling,Labeling|2978|3007\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3878|3907\nLoaded_Language|4007|4020."}

{"prompt":"America's Immigration Voice.\n\nFrom TPM:\nThe Photo That Never Saw The Light of Day: Obama With Farrakhan In 2005 By Esme Cribb | January 25, 2018 2:16 pm A journalist announced last week that he will publish a photograph of then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama (D) and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan that he took in 2005 at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting, but did not make public because he believed it would have “made a difference” to Obama’s political future.\nThe photographer, Askia Muhammad, told the Trice Edney News Wire that he “gave the picture up at the time and basically swore secrecy.” “But after the nomination was secured and all the way up until the inauguration; then for eight years after he was President, it was kept under cover,” Muhammad said.\nAsked whether he thought the photo’s release would have affected Obama’s presidential campaign, Muhammad said, “I insist.\nIt absolutely would have made a difference.” Reached by TPM on Thursday, Muhammad said a “staff member” for the CBC contacted him “sort of in a panic” after he took the photo at a caucus meeting in 2005.\nTPM has published the photo above with Muhammad’s permission.\n“I sort of understood what was going on,” Muhammad told TPM.\n“I promised and made arrangements to give the picture to Leonard Farrakhan,” the minister’s son-in-law and chief of staff.\nMuhammad said he gave away “the disk” from his camera but “copied the photograph from that day onto a file” on his computer.\n“Realizing that I had given it up, I mean, it was sort of like a promise to keep the photograph secret,” Muhammad said.\nMuhammad said he did not release his copy of the photograph because he thought it would be perceived as a betrayal of that promise: “I was really, I guess, afraid of them.”\nMalcolm X wasn’t adequately afraid of them.\nHere’s what happened to him:\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/qSm1t3Uv9QI\nMuhammad said he thought the photograph would be “damaging politically” if it were released and was afraid that someone might “break into his apartment” looking for it, like “that Watergate crap.” He said he “felt a little bit more at ease” after Farrakhan in 2016 claimed that Obama visited his home in Chicago.\nMuhammad contacted Farrakhan in autumn 2017 with the “final manuscript” for a self-published book containing the photo.\n“I sent him a copy of the manuscript suggesting that, showing him the picture, and saying to him, if he did not object, I was going to publish it,” Muhammad said.\n“He had no objection.” … During Obama’s presidential campaign, conservatives pushed multiple apparently racially motivated conspiracy theories about Obama’s religion and supposed ties to Islam.\nFor example, in Obama’s memoir subtitled A Story of Race and Inheritance, Obama recounts his being a regular reader of Minister Farrakhan’s Nation of Islam newspaper The Final Call.\nObama recollects Farrakhan’s black nationalist capitalist campaign to get black people to use toothpaste manufactured by black-owned businesses.\nFarrakhan’s eventual failure suggests to Obama that’s there is more economic upside for blacks in shaking down white institutions than in building their own.\nDuring the 2008 presidential election, conservatives questioned the indirect ties between Farrakhan and Obama, who attended a church that gave Farrakhan an award.\nObama’s “spiritual advisor” Rev.\nJeremiah Wright gave Farrakhan his church’s Lifetime Achievement award in a downtown Chicago Hyatt Regency in November 2007, but the story didn’t make the press until the following year.\nSimilarly, very little media attention was paid to the close relationship between Obama’s fundraiser and private mentor Tony Rezko and the Nation of Islam, even though Rezko’s role was business manager for Nation of Islam assets, such as the career of Muhammad Ali.\nBut after all, what could be more boring than a story than involves a Presidential candidate, the Syrian Christian crook who helped him buy his house, the Nation of Islam, and the most famous boxer of all time?\nReading Obama’s 1995 memoir, you might almost get the impression that after a prudent first term, during his second he might side with, I dunno, Black Lives Matter and encourage a wave of black rage and police retreat that drove up the death toll from murder by 20% in his last two years in office, an incremental death toll a little bigger than the U.S. combat death toll from the equally stupid Iraq War.\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|3313|3330\nLoaded_Language|1027|1045\nRepetition|2959|2964\nLoaded_Language|3081|3112\nLoaded_Language|4189|4199\nDoubt|4001|4406\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1962|2033\nLoaded_Language|2056|2060."}

Pompeo held delicate talks Tuesday with the rulers of Saudi Arabia amid growing suspicions that a Virginia-based Saudi columnist was killed on their orders.\nPompeo did not report any progress following a day of meetings in Riyadh with Saudi King Salman and his powerful son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler.\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday ordered Pompeo to rush to the desert kingdom to try to determine the fate of the missing journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, and the diplomat quickly hopped a plane.\nIn his meetings, Pompeo conveyed “U.S.\nconcern” about Khashoggi’s disappearance two weeks ago, the State Department said, and stressed “the importance of a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation.”\nThe talks were “direct and candid,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.\nPompeo reminded his hosts that despite the numerous bilateral issues the two governments share, determining Khashoggi’s fate was the urgent purpose of this trip, she said.\nKhashoggi, a prominent critic of the autocratic Saudi leadership, was last seen entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on Oct. 2, where he was seeking papers to marry his fiancée.\nTurkish media reports, based in part on apparent audio recordings, have said Khashoggi was beaten to death and then dismembered in the building.\nA 15-member Saudi military team had entered the consulate with a bone saw shortly before Khashoggi arrived, and flew out of the country soon after, the reports said.\nSaudi officials insisted that Khashoggi left the consulate but have provided no video or other evidence.\nThey have denied any responsibility for his disappearance.\nHoping to stem a growing furor, Trump on Monday suggested “rogue killers,” not the Saudi royal family, may have carried out the murder.\nCritics quickly said that Trump was providing an excuse for the Saudi leaders, and participating in a cover-up.\nThat seemed to set the stage for Saudi officials to find a way to explain away the alleged shocking death.\nThey floated the idea later Monday of claiming that Khashoggi, who wrote opinion pieces for the Washington Post and Arab media, was accidentally killed in an interrogation gone awry inside the consulate — supposedly without the approval of the king or crown prince.\nPublicly, Pompeo and his hosts looked calm and friendly when they met Tuesday in Riyadh.\nAt one point, as they greeted each other, Prince Mohammed noted the two countries were important allies.\n“Absolutely,” Pompeo said, smiling.\nThe United States long guaranteed Saudi security in exchange for a steady supply of oil.\nThose ties have frayed even as the Trump administration has embraced the Saudi rulers as a crucial regional ally in efforts to constrain Iran and to craft a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians.\nThe current crisis has put those broader goals at risk, and the White House has scrambled to find a face-saving solution for the Saudi rulers.\nTrump has said he would impose “severe” punishment if proof emerges that Saudi rulers sanctioned Khashoggi’s murder, but he has not said what that would entail.\nHe has ruled out cancelling or suspending billions of dollars in arms deals with the oil-rich country.\nMany members of Congress have demanded the White House take tougher actions, including punitive sanctions on Saudi rulers.\nBut Congress has taken no action on its own.\n— Tracy Wilkinson\nLos Angeles Times\n———\n©2018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|2185|2199\nLoaded_Language|105|114\nLoaded_Language|575|579\nLoaded_Language|700|706\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1462|1498\nLoaded_Language|3165|3173."}

Danny Davis had defended Farrakhan.\nDemocratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis defended Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as an “outstanding human being” on Monday.\nFarrakhan’s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks, saying white people “deserve to die” and praising Adolf Hitler as a “very great man.” “I personally know [Farrakhan], I’ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,” Davis told TheDC.\nThe JTA's awkward attempt to whitewash the newly revealed CBC anti-Semitism included a claim from the ADL that Rep. Davis had been misquoted.\nAn ADL official told JTA on Friday that the group had reached out to Rep. Danny Davis, a Democrat, after an article in The Daily Caller said he lauded Farrakhan on Monday as “an outstanding human being.” Farrakhan has calledJews “the enemy of God and the enemy of the righteous,” and said Jews were responsible for the 9\/11 terror attacks and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the 20th century.\n“The congressman was insistent that The Daily Caller misquoted him during the interview and that he didn’t subscribe to Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic statements and actions in the past,” the ADL official told JTA in a statement.\n“He expressed an interest in seeing some of the latest statements made by Farrakhan vis-a-vis Jews, which we promptly shared with him.” The official said the ADL had shared information with Davis about Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic statements, and that the organization was waiting to hear back from him.\nNow, Rep. Davis would really like to emphasize that the ADL is wrong and he loves Farrakhan.\nDemocratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis confirmed in an interview Sunday that he has a personal relationship with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a notorious anti-Semite, and said he isn’t bothered by Farrakhan’s position on “the Jewish question.” Farrakhan has repeatedly denounced Jews as “satanic,” praised Hitler as a “very great man” and has said that white people “deserve to die.” The congressman wasn’t sure why the ADL wrote that he had been misquoted in his praise for the anti-Semite, and said he wasn’t sure if someone from his office had told the ADL he was misquoted, he told The Daily Caller News Foundation on Sunday.\n“I think that was what they wanted to write.\nNah, I don’t have no problems with Farrakhan, I don’t spend a whole lot of my time dealing with those kind of things,” Davis said.\n“That’s just one segment of what goes on in our world.\nThe world is so much bigger than Farrakhan and the Jewish question and his position on that and so forth.\nFor those heavy into it, that’s their thing, but it ain’t my thing,” he said\nThe people who talk about the \"Jewish question\" are generally anti-Semites.\nSomehow I don't think a white congressman would get away with saying that he agrees with David Duke on the environment but isn't especially concerned about his racism.\nBut black leaders have gotten away with playing that game with Farrakhan repeatedly.\nBut the ADL and the JTA will whitewash this again.\nAnd if they can't whitewash this, they'll ignore it.\n>","completion":" Repetition|3467|3476\nLoaded_Language|914|942\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|1250|1437\nThought-terminating_Cliches|2926|3030\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|3489|3540\nRepetition|1440|1526\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|2015|2054\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|2334|2446\nCausal_Oversimplification|3109|3183."}
{"prompt":"Chile 'cover-up' letter contradicts Pope\n\n© EPA Pope Francis's trip to Chile and Peru was overshadowed by he row\nA victim of a paedophile priest in Chile has revealed he wrote to the Pope in 2015 about an alleged cover-up after Francis denied getting evidence.\nJuan Carlos Cruz, a victim of cleric Fernando Karadima in the 1980s, accused fellow priest Juan Barros of witnessing the abuse and doing nothing.\nThe Pope caused outrage after a visit to Chile last month by defending Bishop Barros, who was made a bishop in 2015.\nThe Vatican refused to comment on the letter when approached by BBC News.\nPope Francis has said in the past that dealing with abuse is vital for the Church's credibility and perpetrators must face \"sanctions\".\nWhat allegations does the letter make?\nMr Cruz sent the text of his letter (written in Spanish) to BBC News, showing it was addressed personally to Pope Francis and dated 3 March 2015.\nThat was more than two weeks before the bishop's ordination in the south Chilean city of Osorno, an event dramatically disrupted by hundreds of protesters accusing Bishop Barros of covering up Karadima's sex attacks on young boys.\nThe bishop has denied ever knowing about \"the serious abuses\" committed by Karadima, who was never prosecuted in Chile because so much time had passed but was convicted and sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of \"penance and prayer\".\n\"Holy Father, I decided to write this letter to you because I'm tired of fighting, crying and suffering,\" Mr Cruz writes.\n© AFP Cardinal O'Malley (centre) accompanied the Pope in Latin America\n\"Our story is well known and there's no point reminding you of it, except to tell you of the horror of having experienced this abuse and how I wanted to kill myself.\"\nIn his letter, he also attaches the full text of a previous letter written a month earlier to the Vatican's top diplomat in Chile, Archbishop Ivo Scapolo.\nIn that letter, Mr Cruz accuses Bishop Barros of \"doing all the dirty work of Fernando Karadima\", and describes the abuse he suffered and which Bishop Barros allegedly witnessed.\n\"When we were in a room with Karadima and Juan Barros, if he [Barros] wasn't kissing Karadima, he watched as one of us, the youngest, was touched by Karadima and forced to give him kisses,\" he writes.\n\"Karadima would say to me: 'Put your mouth next to mine and stick out your tongue.'\nHe'd stick out his and kiss us with his tongue.\nJuan Barros witnessed all of this on countless occasions, not just in my case but in the case of others as well.\"\nAddressing himself to Pope Francis, Mr Cruz says: \"Holy Father, Juan Barros says he saw nothing and yet, there are dozens of us who can testify to the fact that not only was he present when Karadima abused us, but that he, too, kissed Karadima and they touched each other.\"\nHe concludes the letter with this appeal: \"Please Holy Father, don't be like the others.\nThere are so many of us who despite everything think that you can do something.\nI treasure my faith, it's what sustains me, but it is slipping away from me.\"\nHasn't the Pope already apologised?\n© AFP Karadima was only punished by the Vatican\nThe remarks that the Pope had made in January that caused such offence were: \"The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will speak.\nThere is not a single piece of proof against him.\nEverything is slander.\nIs this clear?\"\nThe Pope later apologised for hurting victims' feelings \"without meaning to\" but continued to insist there was \"no evidence\" against the bishop.\n\"In Barros's case, it was studied,\" he said.\n\"It was restudied.\nAnd there is no evidence...\nI don't have evidence to convict.\"\nHow far did the letter get?\n© Reuters Bishop Barros (centre) was greeted by angry protesters at his ordination\nMembers of the Pope's own Commission for the Protection of Minors, set up in 2014 as part of efforts to counter sex abuse by clergy, have told the Associated Press they hand-delivered the letter to Francis's top adviser on sex abuse, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, in April 2015.\nA photo in the AP report shows Marie Collins, a member of the commission at the time, handing the letter to the cardinal.\n\"When we gave him the letter for the Pope, he assured us he would give it to the Pope and speak of the concerns,\" she told AP.\n\"And at a later date, he assured us that that had been done.\"\nMr Cruz told the BBC that Cardinal O'Malley had called him later in 2015 to say he had given the letter to the Pope.\nCardinal O'Malley, whose spokesman referred requests for comment to the Vatican, has earned respect for his work in tackling sex abuse by clergy in Boston.\nCardinal O'Malley's disgraced predecessor, the late Cardinal Bernard Law, had moved paedophile priests between parishes rather than addressing victims' claims.\nIn an unusual step, Cardinal O'Malley openly criticised the Pope last month for his initial remarks in Chile, saying he had left victims feeling abandoned.\nPope Francis announced last week he was sending the Vatican's top expert on sexual abuse, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to Chile to investigate the accusations against Bishop Barros.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”\n\nRecently a Muslim spokesman in Tunisia named Said Khecharem, who is affiliated with the international pro-Sharia, pro-caliphate organization Hizb ut-Tahrir, declared (to delighted screams of “Allahu akbar” from his audience), that the “establishment of an Islamic state…requires the conquest of America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy – Rome and other infidel lands will be conquered, Allah willing.”\nAccording to the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), Khecharem also said: “After the laws of Allah were abandoned, and the heretic regimes were imposed on the Muslims, the most important thing to do is to restore the rule of the Muslims, through the Quran and the Sunna, in order to renew Islamic life and to deliver the Islamic message to the world.\nMy brothers, the implication of this today should be the establishment of an Islamic state over all the lands of the Muslims.”\n﻿\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\n* Yes, he will be confirmed.\nNo, he will not be confirmed.\nEmail *\nEmail This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nAnd no call to restore the caliphate would be complete without a swipe at the Jews, whom the Qur’an designates (5:82) the worst enemies of the Muslims.\nKhecharem predicted that “this will happen, of course, after the elimination of the filthy Jewish entity, and after liberation of the lands under direct colonization, like Kashmir and others.”\nIf Said Khecharem were a non-Muslim saying that Muslims needed to destroy “the filthy Jewish entity” and conquer America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy, he would be accused of “Islamophobia” and “bigotry.” But no one will take any particular notice of this.\nThey should, however.\nKhecharem is not some deluded fanatic raving on a Tunisian street corner.\nHe was speaking at Hizb ut-Tahrir’s International Caliphate Conference; although Hizb ut-Tahrir is banned in many countries, it still has an international presence, and recently held a conference in Chicago.\nNor is the desire to establish a global caliphate limited to Hizb ut-Tahrir alone.\nThe word khalifa means “successor”; the caliph in Sunni Islamic theology is the successor of Muhammad as the military, political, and spiritual leader of the Muslims.\nAs I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS , the great caliphates of history, from the immediate post-Muhammad period of the “Rightly Guided Caliphs” to the Umayyads, Abbasids, and Ottomans, as well as other Islamic states, all waged relentless jihad warfare against non-Muslims, subjugating them under the rule of Islamic law and denying them basic rights.\nThese weren’t the actions of a “tiny minority of extremists,” abhorred by the vast majority of peaceful Muslims for “hijacking” their religion.\nThis was, for fourteen centuries, mainstream, normative Islam, carried forth by the primary authorities in the Islamic world at the time.\nThe History of Jihad shows from the accounts of eyewitnesses and contemporary chroniclers through the ages that in every age and in every place where there were Muslims, some of them believed that they had a responsibility given to them by Allah to wage war against and subjugate unbelievers under the rule of Islamic law.\nAnd so it is today: Said Khecharem has enunciated that responsibility more clearly and directly than most Muslim spokesmen do these days, but he is by no means the only one who believes that it exists.\nWhat is noteworthy also about The History of Jihad is something that it does not contain.\nAs the jihadis move against non-Muslim states without any letup, pause, period of coexistence, period of tolerance, reformation, or reconsideration, there never appears any force of Muslims to oppose them.\nWhile it is undoubtedly true that not all Muslims in any given age have ever waged jihad, there has never been in Islamic history an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad and dedicated to stopping those who were waging it.\nSo it is today.\nIslamic groups in the West issue pro-forma condemnations after every jihad terror attack, but are doing little or nothing to try to prevent the next one.\nThere is still no mosque or Islamic school in the United States that teaches young Muslims why they should reject the understanding of Islam taught by al-Qaeda, ISIS, and other jihad terror groups.\nMeanwhile, Said Khecharem and other Islamic spokesmen openly call for Muslims to engage in jihad conquest.\nWestern authorities should be pondering his words, and their implications, very carefully.\nInstead, if they have taken any notice of him at all, which is unlikely, they have dismissed him as an “extremist.”\nThey have yet to come to grips with the fact that “extremism” is and always has been so distressingly widespread in Muslim communities.\nBut they will.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|253|287\nLoaded_Language|472|485\nFlag-Waving|314|470\nFlag-Waving|573|973\nLoaded_Language|1561|1580\nLoaded_Language|1705|1754\nName_Calling,Labeling|3068|3181\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|4561|4757\nName_Calling,Labeling|5057|5070\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|5073|5222\nName_Calling,Labeling|1616|1648\nLoaded_Language|3156|3165."}
{"prompt":"New Audio From The Night Of The Las Vegas Massacre Reveals That There Was “Another Active Shooter” In The Bar At The Top Of The Mandalay Bay Hotel During The Attack\n\nNewly released audio from the Clark County Fire Department has provided even more proof that there were multiple shooters during The Las Vegas Massacre, further debunking the official narrative of a lone gunman on the 32nd floor and once again calling into question almost every aspect of what actually happened during the worst mass shooting in American history.\nThe audio, released on the SoundCloud account of a local news reporter, is an almost three hour recording of transmissions between dispatch and units on the ground amid the confusion of the mass shooting that at one point details a report that a wife of a firefighter was actually pinned down in the Foundation Room bar on top of the Mandalay Hotel.\nIntellihub’s Shepard Ambellas, who has extensively reported on the entire Vegas cover-up since the beginning, recently found that at around the 1:27:54 mark of the audio file you can clearly hear dispatch describing the situation to first responders who are headed in that direction.\n“We have a firefighter’s wife at this event who is pinned down behind the bar at Mandalay Bay.\nWe are trying to get further on the name,” dispatch frantically notes.\n“Batallion 6, be advised that we are getting reports on Mandalay Bay, at the bar, we currently have, another active shooter up there.”\nAfter being asked to confirm the information, dispatch goes on to make clear that she is specifically speaking about the bar at the top of the hotel rather than anywhere near the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock supposedly operated from.\n“The only information I have is it’s the bar on top of the Mandalay Bay,” dispatch continues before being asked if the shooter was pinned down or “just sheltering right now?”\nInterestingly, the story doesn’t end there, as Ambellas wrote in his piece, author and entrepreneur Grant Cardone was actually holding an investors meeting in the very same bar shortly before the attack took place.\nThe popular social media influencer apparently left the Foundation Room literally seven minutes before authorities claim Paddock opened fire from his 32nd floor room.\nCardone wrote about his experience in a post on Medium in which he claimed that the Mandalay Bay was telling visitors that there was at least one active shooter, “moving” throughout the hotel shooting people.\nIt was reported by the Mandalay there was a shooter moving through the hotel.\nI told Elena and Johnny, “stay close to me, we are not running out, stay calm, there is one person in charge — where I go, you follow, no matter what.” […] About this time, there was starting to be a lot more activity through the casino and now the reports suggested there was active multiple terrorists moving through the hotel shooting guest.\nThen twitter started showing up with feeds suggesting multiple hotels being attacked, bomb threats, and more.\nThis new report documenting yet another instance of a possible second shooter comes on the heels of dozens of similar reports, with the most recent arriving in the form of air traffic control audio that directly stated that there were active shooters on the runway.\n“During the air traffic control recordings, which were released by political strategist and co-founder of “The New Right” Mike Tokes, one of the dispatchers is heard telling an incoming plane that landing might not be a good idea because there were multiple active shooters on the airport property itself,” SHTFplan reported.\n“Shutting down might not be a good idea, there’s active shooters on the runway,” he declared.\n“The 19s are closed, we are in the process of trying to round them up, they are on the airport property.”\nAir traffic control tapes on the night of the Las Vegas shooting: “There’s active shooters on the runway.\nThey’re on the airport property” pic.twitter.com\/HZf3LBeAgk — Mike Tokes (@MikeTokes) October 29, 2017\nSlowly but surely we are beginning to see the truth about the horrific attack come to light despite authorities desperately trying to prevent it from reaching the American people.\nSadly, the picture emerging is one that includes a shocking amount of evidence pointing towards a classic deep state false flag operation.\n>","completion":" Doubt|4007|4185\nFlag-Waving|4107|4185\nDoubt|4187|4324\nLoaded_Language|4285|4324."}
{"prompt":"Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack\n\nNewly released footage of the Las Vegas Massacre, captured by a private surveillance camera and recently released by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, has once again ignited the theory that helicopters were used during the horrific attack.\nOver the last month multiple videos have been released that many believe show helicopters either conducting an attack on the Vegas Strip or attempting to stop those that were and now, with this latest evidence release, that possibility seems all the more plausible.\nAs Shepard Ambellas reported for Intellihub, “The [footage] is presumed to have been captured by a nearby business’s southward facing security camera which is located approximately 780 feet due east of the venue where the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival was held on Oct. 1.\nThe tape was given to Fox News by an attorney who represents several shooting victims.”\nAmazingly, the surveillance camera captured what seems to show a “large amount” of wind and debris being kicked up by a nearby helicopter hovering above the attack and or taking part in it.\n“Astonishingly, between the times of 10:13 and 10:16 a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera,” Ambellas continued.\n“By 10:14 much larger crowds of people can be seen streaming through the area to escape the massacre going on,” Carlson reported.\n“You can see a large amount of wind and debris, apparently that is due to a helicopter hovering overhead.”\nThe footage goes how to show two men attempt to help a victim who had apparently been shot, eventually resorting to covering up the body after they realized it was simply too late.\nAmbellas also reported on what his research indicates were documented helicopters in the air at the time.\nA quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m., several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen.\nHowever, the departure of the choppers and the fact that several of them overflew the parking lot does not explain all of the debris being kicked up from by a heavy downdraft, prop wash, possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer.\nIn fact, the downdraft appears to be constant from 10:13-10:16 p.m. and not intermittent as if several choppers had just passed overhead.\nAs I have reported in the past, multiple other videos taken on the night of the attack also seem to point to helicopters being used throughout the city.\n“Footage has emerged that may show muzzle flashes coming from the helicopter in what looks to be evidence that a team was firing into the crowd from the air on that fateful night,” read a report in The Daily Sheeple.\n“Despite claims by some that these are “strobes” it remains unlikely that this is the case, especially when you consider other footage of the helicopter taken on the night as well as research by a group of investigators who believe the first attack on October 1st was carried out from the air.”\nIt is also important to keep in mind that there is footage of a still unidentified team loading up gear in a helicopter near the scene of the attack.\n“In what can only be described as a “WTF video” the following footage seems to literally show a team of unknown soldiers gearing up next to a helicopter near the Route 91 concert.”\nAdditionally, Carlson also noted during the initial broadcast of the private surveillance footage that the owner of the camera was never approached by the FBI, who have so far never seen the footage, much less investigated it.\nWhile we may never know what actually happened during the Las Vegas Massacre, the fact remains that the official story has been proven, time and time again, to be absolutely false and in fact nothing more than a pathetic attempt at a cover-up.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|3353|3363\nDoubt|3802|3966\nDoubt|992|1001\nDoubt|2911|2939\nDoubt|3724|3747\nLoaded_Language|3934|3952."}

{"prompt":"Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case\n\nWASHINGTON — Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo expressed confidence Wednesday that the Saudi government could be trusted to investigate the disappearance and suspected murder of a U.S.-based Saudi journalist in a Saudi diplomatic facility in Turkey — despite the likelihood that senior Saudi officials were involved.\nSpeaking in Ankara, Turkey, Pompeo offered that support hours after President Donald Trump had mounted an even stronger defense for the Saudi rulers, saying, “Here we go again with you’re guilty until proven innocent.”\nTogether they appeared to signal a shift in White House strategy — earlier this week Trump had warned Saudi rulers could face “severe punishment” — and suggested the administration has decided to help its most important ally in the Arab world defuse an international crisis over the fate of Jamal Khashoggi.\nThe dissident journalist, who lived in Virginia, vanished Oct. 2 after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.\nNeither Trump nor his top diplomat offered any new facts or insights in the case.\nBut unless authorities recover his body or other conclusive evidence of his death, the mystery may remain unsolved.\nPompeo wrapped up two days of emergency talks in the region — first with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, and then with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara — and headed back to Washington on Wednesday.\nTurkish officials have described — but have not released — what they say are audio and video recordings that show the 60-year-old contributor to the Washington Post opinion pages was interrogated, tortured and killed by Saudi intelligence officers inside the consulate.\nTurkish officials say Khashoggi’s body was cut up with a bone saw, then taken out of the building.\nTurkish crime scene investigators and forensic specialists were allowed to search for evidence in the Saudi consulate and a nearby residence on Tuesday.\nErdogan later complained that the interior walls had been repainted in recent days.\nOn his flight from Riyadh to Ankara, Pompeo reiterated his confidence that the Saudi government would conduct a “thorough, complete, and transparent investigation,” adding that they will “show the entire world” the results.\nHe said Saudi leaders made a commitment “to hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that, whether they are a senior officer or official.” He said they made “no exceptions,” including presumably members of the royal family.\nAsked if the Saudis had informed him whether Khashoggi was alive or dead, Pompeo said, “I don’t want to talk about any of the facts.\nThey didn’t want to either, in that they want to have the opportunity to complete this investigation in a thorough way.”\nAsked if he believed the Saudi rulers’ repeated denial of complicity, Pompeo said he was reserving judgment.\n“I think that’s — I think that’s — I think that’s a reasonable thing to do, to give them that opportunity,” Pompeo said, “(and then) we’ll all get to evaluate the work that they do.”\nPompeo refused to discuss possible consequences for those found responsible for Khashoggi’s disappearance, reiterating at least three times the “importance of the investigation.”\nLater Wednesday, Pompeo said during a refueling stopover in Brussels that Erdogan had informed him the Saudis were cooperating with the Turkish investigation “after a couple of delays.”\nTurkish officials “seemed pretty confident the Saudis will permit them to do things they need to do to complete” the investigation, Pompeo told reporters traveling with him.\nIn a sign that the administration is looking to help Saudi Arabia get out of its dilemma, Pompeo urged Americans to be mindful of the extensive energy, economic and security ties between Riyadh and Washington, including efforts against what he called the world’s largest supporter of terrorism, Iran.\n“The Saudis have been great partners in working alongside us on these issues,” Pompeo said.\n“We need to make sure we are mindful of that as we approach decisions” on whether to impose sanctions or take other punitive steps against Riyadh, as many in Congress and elsewhere have urged.\nCritics questioned whether the Saudi rulers, who preside over an authoritarian regime that allows little opposition, can be relied on to conduct a credible probe into Khashoggi’s fate — especially without decisive pressure from their close ally, the Trump administration.\nSaudi leaders for two weeks denied knowing anything about the Khashoggi case.\nOn Monday, they began floating a scenario — initially adopted by Trump — that blamed the murder inside the consulate on “rogue killers,” and then suggested the writer was accidentally killed during an interrogation that went awry.\nAnalysts familiar with the desert kingdom said it was likely Saudi leaders were hoping the scandal would blow over and that they could wait it out.\n“We received commitments that they would complete this (investigation), and I am counting on them to do that,” Pompeo said.\n“They gave me their word.”\n— Tracy Wilkinson\nLos Angeles Times\n———\n©2018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by

{"prompt":"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: \"Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium\" (Now what?)\n\nGiven that Pope Francis has, since that interview took place, attempted to make the Argentine bishops’ interpretation of AL 'magisterial'--an interpretation that allows public adulterers to receive Holy Communion--Cardinal Burke’s reply to my question on January 9th of this year would seem to take on new relevancy.\nIn my interview of Raymond Cardinal Burke less than one year ago, I asked His Eminence to clarify what, exactly, is the level of authoritative weight of Pope Francis’s post-synodal exhortation, Amoris Laetitia.\nNow, Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, president of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, made it very clear to the Catholic News Service on December 5 what the Pope is up to: “The fact that the pope requested that his letter and the interpretations of the Buenos Aires bishops be published in the AAS means that His Holiness has given these documents a particular qualification that elevates them to the level of being official teachings of the church.\nWhile the content of the pope’s letter itself does not contain teachings on faith and morals, it does point toward the interpretations of the Argentine bishops and confirms them as authentically reflecting his own mind.\nThus together the two documents became the Holy Father’s authentic magisterium for the whole church.”\nWhat Cardinal Burke rightly describes as lacking in any magisterial weight whatsoever—and, in fact, in dire need of clarification and correction— has by papal fiat been declared magisterial, and thus binding on us all.\nFrancis made it clear that the Argentine bishops’ interpretation of AL allowing public adulterers to receive Holy Communion “explains precisely the meaning of Chapter VIII of ‘Amoris Laetitia.’ There are no other interpretations.”\nI would imagine this outrageous overreach of papal authority on the Pope's part would make it ominously clear to Cardinal Burke that the time has come to issue his public correction of Pope Francis's erroneous teaching.\nThe moment, it would seem, has come.\nCardinal Burke, please and in God's Holy Name, we beg you to act now -- before Pope Francis succeeds in tearing the Church in half completely.\nWe fear that your silence now, in the face of this latest papal travesty, may suggest consent to the claim that Amoris Laetitia is magisterial, and thus prove more damaging than if you had never raised your voice at all.\nWe thank God for the courage you've shown in defending His Church thus far, and we pray he will continue to bless and protect you as you do what must now be done.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|1438|1483\nAppeal_to_Authority|1616|1846\nLoaded_Language|1868|1907\nLoaded_Language|1941|1956\nLoaded_Language|2293|2319\nLoaded_Language|2134|2245."}

{"prompt":"Jewish and Pro-Israel Students Kicked Off University Board for Opposing BDS\n\nFirst they came for the Jews.\nAnd then they came for everyone else.\nJewish students have already faced plenty of harassment and hate at McGill.\nThe latest incident at the Canadian university comes with a rather blatant agenda.\nA Jewish student at McGill University has been kicked off the student government board for having “conflicts of interest” due to his pro-Israel activism.\nThird-year student Noah Lew was one of 12 board members up for general assembly ratification on Monday evening following his victory as vice-president finance of the Arts Undergraduate Society.\nThe ratification vote is typically a mere formality, but Monday’s was different due to Democratize Student Society of McGill University (SSMU), an organization that was established to resist the university’s ban of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement on campus.\nDemocratize SSMU was able to pass a motion that required each board member to be voted upon separately under the grounds that they weren’t a fan of the names.\nWhen it was Lew’s turn, he was voted down, 105 to 73 with 12 abstaining, with applause following the vote.\nTwo other students who had criticized BDS, Alexander Scheffel and Josephine Wright O’Manique, were also voted down.\nDemocratize SSMU had targeted Lew and the other two students on the board because they had connections to the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee (CJPAC) and were involved in getting the BDS ban passed, which Democratize SSMU claimed were “conflicts of interests.”\nSomehow I don't think being a member of a Muslim student group and supporting BDS would be considered a conflict of interest.\nBut the campus anti-Israel crowd has been working rather hard to intimidate and penalize anyone involved in pro-Israel organizations.\nAnd to keep their racist boycott movement going by maintaining control over student governments.\nLew shared the experience on Facebook.\n“I have no doubt from the information circulated about me and campaign run against me prior to this vote that this was about my Jewish identity, and nothing more,” wrote Lew.\n“I was blocked from being able to participate in my student government because I am Jewish, because I have been affiliated with Jewish organizations, and because I believe in the right to Jewish self-determination.” Lew added that the experience shows the inherent anti-Semitism in the BDS movement.\n“If BDS is not anti-Semitic, why did a BDS-led campaign name and shame me for my affiliation with a Jewish organization, and call on students to remove me from student government for this reason?” wrote Lew.\n“If BDS is not anti-Semitic, why was I barred from participating in student government because of my Jewish identity?”\nThere are some more details here and a petition.\nOn Monday night, three students were removed from the Board of Directors of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), McGill’s main student government.\nAll three were targeted for removal either because they are Jewish or have vocally opposed anti-Jewish discrimination on campus.\nThis episode is utterly unacceptable, and is merely the latest in a long string of antisemitic incidents at your university.\nIndeed, according to eyewitnesses, one of the members of the mob that removed the three directors was Igor Sadikov.\nYou will remember Sadikov as the student politician who in February told his followers to “punch a Zionist today.” It is unclear whether Sadikov has faced any disciplinary action for this incitement to violence from your administration.\nAntisemitism at McGill does not emerge from a vacuum.\nRather, it has been nurtured in part by a toxic campus press, especially the McGill Daily, a publication which openly refuses to publish any “Zionist” content.\nIn practice, this prevents McGill’s Jewish community from defending itself against the absurd attacks to which it is subjected.\nIf the Daily is committed to systematically excluding the voices of an ethno-religious community on campus, then it cannot continue to receive automatic student funding, as it does now.\nThe double standard here is pretty clear.\nAnd we know exactly what the reaction would be if a student paper refused to publish any pro-Islamist content.\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_fear-prejudice|4178|4280\nLoaded_Language|31|41\nSlogans|77|143\nLoaded_Language|351|361\nName_Calling,Labeling|1716|1744\nName_Calling,Labeling|1864|1887\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3139|3159\nSlogans|3455|3476\nName_Calling,Labeling|3695|3715\nLoaded_Language|3898|3916\nCausal_Oversimplification|1983|2143\nLoaded_Language|288|302\nDoubt|2486|2651\nDoubt|2666|2781."}

Mollie Hemingway explaining:\nOur relationship with Russia is at a significant low point where just having some conversations can lead us to a better outcome.\nAnd there are so many important things that they are involved with that we care about, whether it’s Syria, Ukraine, North Korea or nuclear arms.\nI’m kind of surprised there’s been this much angst over this press conference.\nNot that he said things the way he should have.\nPresident Trump really did mess up with that press conference but I don’t quite know what people want.\nHe actually is pretty tough on Russia.\nAnd in the last couple of years, we’ve seen an increase in the military budget, we’ve seen an increase in the intelligence budget.\nWe are doing NATO exercises in the Baltics.\nWe provided legal aid to Ukraine and Georgia.\nWe’re developing low-yield nuclear weapons.\nHe implemented sanctions that were even stronger than required by Congressional mandate.\nSo if you care about actual actions, I think there’s a lot to be happy about in terms of a tough posture towards Russia.\nPeople are obsessed about words and they should maybe focus on the actions as well.\nFormer Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, concurred with Hemingway arguing that by any standard Trump has been far tougher on Russia than Obama was.\nFirst, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016.\nThe very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America.\nIt was their duty in 2016 – not candidate Trump’s.\nSecond, the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being.\nThe Trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior.\nThe Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia.\nAlso, President Trump’s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy.\nFurthermore, President Trump’s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin.\nThe stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has.\nBeyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia: Where President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression.\nWhen the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain, President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States.\nWhen the Russians retaliated, the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle.\nPresident Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York.\nMore than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons.\nDespite the hysteria of the left, it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia.\nNothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and

{"prompt":"A colossal Neptunian storm just vanished before our eyes\n\nYou don’t have to look far for fresh news about Mars, Saturn, or Jupiter these days, but Neptune doesn’t always get the same kind of attention.\nThe big frigid blue ball is the farthest planet from the Sun — since we don’t count Pluto as a planet anymore — and it hasn’t been studied with the same intensity of many of the others.\nThankfully the Hubble Space Telescope hasn’t lost interest in the distant planet, because it just captured one of Neptunes massive storms losing steam as it roars across the planet.\nStorms on Neptune appear as giant dark ovals, a bit like Jupiter’s Great Red Spot.\nHowever, unlike Jupiter’s centuries-old storm, Neptune’s hurricane-like weather events only last a few years at a time before eventually dissipating.\nOf course, that’s not to say the storms are insignificant — many are large enough to swallow and entire continent here on Earth — so watching one breathe its dying gasps is still a special sight.\nThe planet, which NASA says is the windiest in our Solar System, hosts regular storms which appear as large spots on its surface, but scientists are still at a loss as to how they actually occur.\n“We have no evidence of how these vortices are formed or how fast they rotate,” Agustín Sánchez-Lavega of the University of the Basque Country in Spain explains.\n“It is most likely that they arise from an instability in the sheared eastward and westward winds.”\nThe observation of this particular storm dying out is significant because it’s the very first time one of Neptune’s storms has been observed in such a way.\nIt also goes against everything that scientists thought they knew about how forms on Neptune live and die.\n“It looks like we’re capturing the demise of this dark vortex, and it’s different from what well-known studies led us to expect,” said Michael H. Wong of the University of California at Berkeley says.\n“Their dynamical simulations said that anticyclones under Neptune’s wind shear would probably drift toward the equator.\nWe thought that once the vortex got too close to the equator, it would break up and perhaps create a spectacular outburst of cloud activity.”\nBut this storm stayed its course, dying out in a horizontal path that didn’t bring it towards the Neptunian equator at all, forcing scientists to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new theory on the planet’s weather habits.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|949|972."}

it embodies it.\nThe Kavkaz Center, a website operated by Chechen jihadists, explained in a 2010 article that the idea of Ramadan as a time for warfare against infidels went back to Muhammad’s time: “The month of Ramadan in the life of the Prophet (pbuh) and the righteous ancestors was a month of forthcoming.\nThe greatest battles during the lifetime of the Prophet (pbuh) occurred in this blessed month, the month of jihad, zeal and enthusiasm.”\nTrump was, unfortunately, following the example of his two immediate predecessors when he claimed that “Ramadan reminds us of the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life,” and was severely misleading the American people.\nIronically, even in doing this he is likely to fail to satisfy Muslims, or anyone.\nAfter all, after the Trump White House issued a similar statement last year, the Washington Post ran a lengthy piece in which several Muslims explained why the statement was unsatisfactory to them.\nShadi Hamid of the Qatar-funded Brookings Institution declared: “Trump has so rarely recognized that American Muslims even exist, but this offers apparent proof that he is aware of our existence.\nGreat!\nPutting all that context aside, it’s offensive and pretty much terrible.”\nWhy?\nBecause Trump had the temerity to mention jihad terrorism.\nHamid continued: “We, as American Muslims, shouldn’t be defined solely in our relationship to bad things that we have nothing to do with.\nWe’re also normal people who happen to be Muslim and to see us and our history in America so narrowly is plain out offensive.”\nWhat is actually offensive is that Hamid would try in this way to absolve the Muslim community of any responsibility to root out jihad terrorist from its midst.\nThere is certain to be more jihad terrorism during this Ramadan, and some of it may be committed by Muslims in the U.S. Hamid, if he cared about this, would be confronting honestly the teachings of Islam that make Ramadan the month of jihad, and working to reform them.\nMeanwhile, it would be dangerous, suicidal folly for Infidels to pretend that Ramadan is not the month of jihad.\nAnd as our Ramadan willful blindness continues, more Infidels will die.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|602|643\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|724|800\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|4492|4664\nName_Calling,Labeling|435|456\nLoaded_Language|3122|3141\nName_Calling,Labeling|0|13\nCausal_Oversimplification|192|238\nLoaded_Language|317|345\nLoaded_Language|557|571\nLoaded_Language|916|955\nLoaded_Language|1638|1677\nCausal_Oversimplification|1745|1828\nLoaded_Language|2107|2121\nLoaded_Language|2368|2387\nCausal_Oversimplification|2405|2485\nName_Calling,Labeling|2528|2545\nRepetition|2630|2638\nName_Calling,Labeling|2856|2894\nRepetition|3069|3111\nFlag-Waving|3122|3161\nLoaded_Language|3640|3645\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|3509|3638\nLoaded_Language|4028|4047\nLoaded_Language|3698|3718\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|4050|4209\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|4331|4479\nLoaded_Language|4504|4542\nLoaded_Language|4613|4630\nName_Calling,Labeling|2415|2423\nName_Calling,Labeling|4647|4655\nName_Calling,Labeling|4534|4542\nName_Calling,Labeling|119|127."}

Bush all thought that the Islamic Republic was not due money that was owed to the Shah.\nOnly Barack Obama did.\nThe definition of treason is giving aid and comfort to the enemy.\nThe leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran order their people to chant “Death to America” in mosques every Friday, and repeatedly vow that they will ultimately destroy the United States of America and the state of Israel.\nHow was giving them billions and helping them skirt sanctions applied by the U.S. government not treason?\nOther Presidents have been incompetent, corrupt, dishonest, but which has committed treason on a scale to rival the treason of Barack Obama?\nThe Iranians also operate a global network of jihad terror organizations, one of which, Hizballah, is quite active in Mexico now, with the obvious ultimate intention of crossing the border and committing jihad massacres of Americans.\nObama has given a tremendous boost to these initiatives, as well as to Iran’s nuclear program, with his nuclear deal that has given the Iranians hundreds of billions of dollars and essentially a green light to manufacture nuclear weapons, in exchange for absolutely nothing.\nThere is no telling when the worst consequences of Obama’s aid and comfort to the Islamic Republic of Iran will be felt.\nBut they likely will be felt in one way or another.\nEven as President Trump moves swiftly to restore sanctions and put Iran on notice that its nuclear activity and global adventurism will not be tolerated, those billions cannot be recovered, and the Iranians have already spent a great deal for their jihad cause.\nHowever this catastrophe plays out, there is one man who will suffer no consequences whatsoever: Barack Obama.\nThat’s Leftist Privilege.\nIt’s good to be a powerful Leftist in Washington nowadays.\nLaws?\nPah!\nLaws are for conservatives.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|8|15\nExaggeration,Minimisation|17|27\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1604|1613\nName_Calling,Labeling|1861|1893\nName_Calling,Labeling|2258|2287\nRepetition|1184|1191\nRepetition|1454|1461\nRepetition|2515|2522\nRepetition|3164|3171\nRepetition|3532|3539\nRepetition|3625|3632\nRepetition|3657|3664\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1536|1567\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2377|2389\nSlogans|3284|3302\nLoaded_Language|3892|3901\nLoaded_Language|3934|3944\nExaggeration,Minimisation|336|346\nName_Calling,Labeling|1763|1782\nLoaded_Language|3568|3579\nLoaded_Language|3581|3588\nLoaded_Language|3590|3599\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|3875|3901\nFlag-Waving|3902|3914\nLoaded_Language|4639|4650."}

Robert Menendez (D-N.J.).\nMr. Pompeo promised to “take a look at it.”\nThat’s not enough.\nGhost guns are already a problem; they are used not just by lone shooters but as part of criminal enterprises.\nReleasing instructions for their manufacture, which now only circulate on the dark Web, will lead directly to the loss of more innocent lives.\nThe administration should stop the State Department from going ahead with this foolhardy move, and Congress should act to plug the loopholes that these guns are designed to take advantage of.\n>","completion":" Doubt|1743|1825\nName_Calling,Labeling|2451|2491\nLoaded_Language|2632|2644\nDoubt|2632|2753\nName_Calling,Labeling|1373|1476\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|2856|3300\nLoaded_Language|17|41\nLoaded_Language|334|342\nName_Calling,Labeling|343|417\nName_Calling,Labeling|722|732\nDoubt|813|1045\nLoaded_Language|1722|1740\nLoaded_Language|2168|2191\nLoaded_Language|3184|3203\nLoaded_Language|3229|3250\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|2856|2965."}

{"prompt":"No Justice for Kate Steinle\n\nA San Francisco jury on Thursday found Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, also known as Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, not guilty of the murder of Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier on July 1, 2015.\nThe jury of six men and six women, including three immigrants, found the Mexican national not guilty of all murder and manslaughter charges and guilty only of felony possession of a firearm.\nFor Garcia’s Zarate’s attorney, Matt Gonzalez, Ralph Nader’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election, the trial was all about Donald Trump.\n“For those who might criticize this verdict – there are a number of people who have commented on this case in the last couple of years,” Gonzalez said after the verdict, “the Attorney General of the United States and the President and Vice President of the United States.\nLet me just remind them, they are themselves under investigation by a special prosecutor in Washington D.C. and they may soon avail themselves of the presumption of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt, so I ask that they reflect on that before they comment or disparage the results of this case.”\n“From day one this case was used as a means to foment hate, to foment division and to foment a program of mass deportation,” added defense attorney Francisco Ugarte.\n“It was used to catapult a presidency along that philosophy of hate of others.\nI believe today is a day of vindication for the rights of immigrants.”\nAlex Bastian of the San Francisco prosecutor’s office told reporters the verdict “was not the one we were hoping for,” but the Steinle family could be forgiven for any reasonable doubts about the prosecution.\n“We’re just shocked — saddened and shocked ... that’s about it,” Jim Steinle, Kate’s father, told the San Francisco Chronicle.\n“There’s no other way you can coin it.\nJustice was rendered, but it was not served.” Kate’s brother Brad was “stunned that they couldn’t even get him on using the weapon.”\nAttorney David Wohl told Fox News that with negligent discharge of a firearm, the defendant’s action met every standard for involuntary manslaughter.\nThe verdict, Wohl said, was “an utter and complete and total failure by the prosecutor.”\nConservative Ben Shapiro told Fox news the verdict was “horrifying.\n.\n.\nPolitics trumps evidence in California once again.” For Jeff Sessions San Francisco’s sanctuary city policy “led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.” According to the Attorney General’s statement, the Justice Department “will continue to ensure that all jurisdictions place the safety and security of their communities above the convenience of criminal aliens.”\nFor his part, President Trump tweeted: “A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case!\nNo wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.”\nMexican national Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 54, is a seven-time felon and has been deported five times.\nIn 2015 federal authorities sought to detain him for deportation.\nSan Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi chose to defy the feds and release the Mexican national.\nOn July 1, 2015, the criminal illegal picked up a Sig Sauer .40 caliber pistol, stolen from a Bureau of Land Management officer, and fired the shot that killed Kate Steinle, only 32 years old.\nThe Mexican nation and career criminal enjoyed all the rights of the American legal system, the presumption of innocence, and a high-profile defense attorney funded by American taxpayers.\nDuring the trial, former vice presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez claimed that Garcia Zarate’s background and nationality played a role in his prosecution.\nAs Gonzalez argued, “If this was a college student or Swedish kid would he be charged with murder?”\nThat sort of politically correct nonsense plays well in San Francisco, so any observer of the case could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted, regardless of the tragedy for the Steinle family.\nThe felony firearms charge, the only charge on which Garcia Zarate was found guilty, carries a sentence of 16 months to 3 years.\nSince Garcia Zarate has been languishing in jail, the authorities could commute any sentence to time served and he could walk free within weeks.\nSan Francisco is not likely to hand the felon over to ICE for deportation.\nShould that happen, Garcia Zarate has already proved five times that anybody can get away with violating U.S. immigration law.\nHe has already proved that in the sanctuary state of California, false-documented illegals are a privileged class.\nJose Ines Garcia Zarate, or whatever his real name is, has also proved that a career criminal who is not even supposed to be in the country can literally get away with murder in broad daylight.\nWhen that happens, the killer’s public defender will call it a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”\nIn San Francisco, and across California, this verdict will surely give new meaning to the cry of “no justice, no peace.”\n>","completion":"

New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N.\nAmbassador John Bolton.\nFor over a decade, Bolton has been calling for regime change in Iran.\nNow, he’s the National Security Advisor.\nIt just so happens that at least one of these calls for regime change in Iran was caught on video last year as Bolton gave a speech at the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran.\n“There is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today.\nI had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs’ regime in Tehran.\nThe behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself.\nAnd that’s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!”\nPay attention to the first line in that quote above in which Bolton notes that the opposition needed to overthrow Iran’s current regime “is centered in this room today.” Who was in that room?\nWell, the entire event was actually put on by the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, also known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK.\nAs Politico pointed out in a 2016 article, despite the neocon attempts to rewrite history, MEK have killed Americans and committed multiple acts of terrorism.\nFor decades, and based on U.S. intelligence, the United States government has blamed the MEK for killing three U.S. Army colonels and three U.S. contractors, bombing the facilities of numerous U.S. companies and killing innocent Iranians.\nTo recap, the formerly terrorist-classified organization MEK, trained in the US and granted special privilege status by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2012—which has since been heavily funded to refine their image by having famous US neoconservative war hawks from both sides of the isle actually chant for “regime change” on their behalf—is now the darling child of the neocon agenda and the impetus behind what could kick of World War 3.\nWhile the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom, the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran or American citizens is outright insane.\nTo see what US intervention—through military support and the support of opposition groups—does to countries, one need only look at Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya to see the horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias left in America’s wake.\nTo those paying attention over the years, Trump’s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media and from all sides of the political spectrum should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report.\nThis was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense.\n“This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years,” Clark said.\n“Starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.”\nAll presidents since Clinton have crossed countries off this list.\nNow it’s Trump’s turn.\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|3964|3977\nLoaded_Language|4439|4447\nLoaded_Language|4244|4259\nLoaded_Language|4464|4485\nLoaded_Language|730|745\nSlogans|2380|2389\nDoubt|3047|3068."}

{"prompt":"Pope admits Catholic Church has ‘long ignored’ problem of child abuse\n\nVATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Monday asked forgiveness for child abuse crimes and cover-ups within the Catholic Church, admitting that the pain of victims “was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced.”\nThe strongly worded statement came ahead of an Aug. 25-26 papal pilgrimage to Ireland, one of the countries rocked by clergy sex abuse scandals, and followed an expose of pedophile priests in the U.S.\n“The heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven, was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced,” Francis said in a Letter to the People of God, a rarely-issued address to the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics.\nOn Aug. 17, a Pennsylvania grand jury report, based on hidden archives of the U.S. church, named 301 priests from the state as credibly accused child sex abusers and accused church leaders of a systematic cover-up of their crimes.\nThe report “detailed the experiences of at least a thousand survivors, victims of sexual abuse, the abuse of power and of conscience at the hands of priests over a period of approximately seventy years,” Francis acknowledged.\n“It is essential that we, as a Church, be able to acknowledge and condemn, with sorrow and shame, the atrocities perpetrated by consecrated persons, clerics, and all those entrusted with the mission of watching over and caring for those most vulnerable,” he said.\n“Let us beg forgiveness for our own sins and the sins of others,” he added.\nIn the run-up to Francis’ visit to Ireland, the head of the Irish Catholic Church, Archbishop Eamon Martin, said he expected the pope to meet with victims of clergy sex abuse and to promise effective remedies.\n“I’m not sure what his words will be and I’m not sure that a simple apology is what survivors of abuse want,” Martin said in a BBC interview.\n“If he expresses an apology, it needs to be more than ‘we’re sorry,’” he added.\nIn his letter, Francis repeated a famous 2005 quote by his predecessor Benedict XVI, who, a month before being elected pope, lamented “how much filth” there was in the Catholic Church.\n“With shame and repentance, we acknowledge as an ecclesial community that we were not where we should have been, that we did not act in a timely manner, realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives.\nWe showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them,” Francis said.\n“Looking back to the past, no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient.\nLooking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated,” he added.\nColm O’Gorman, an Irish abuse survivor who founded One in Four, the main survivors’ group in Ireland, commented on Twitter that the pope offered “Much stronger language than ever used before.”\nBut O’Gorman added: “(The pope) begs for forgiveness, but still does not admit or own the deliberate policy of cover up designed & implemented by the #Vatican.”\nLike his predecessor, Francis has promised “zero tolerance” on child abuse, but scandals have kept recurring in several parts of the world — including in Australia recently.\nIn January, the pope was accused of insensitivity and tone-deafness after insisting, during a visit to Chile, that local abuse survivors had no “proof” against a bishop who allegedly witnessed abuse and failed to report it.\nFollowing an outcry, Francis apologized for his remarks, held private meetings with victims at the Vatican, and, after envoys he sent to Chile backed up victims’ claims, the entire leadership of the Chilean Catholic church tendered their resignations.\nAccording to church expert John L Allen, an editor at specialized website Crux.com, the Catholic Church has a structural problem when it comes to dealing with cover up accusations.\n“Sixteen years since the crisis first erupted in the U.S., almost ten years since that happened in Ireland, and now more than five years since Francis was elected, the Catholic Church still has no credible, transparent process for handling cases when the accusation against a bishop isn’t the direct commission of abuse but rather covering up someone else’s crimes,” Allen said in a Sunday column.\n— Alvise Armellini\ndpa\n———\n©2018 Deutsche Presse-Agentur GmbH (Hamburg, Germany), Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|822|856\nLoaded_Language|2059|2073\nLoaded_Language|473|497\nDoubt|2110|2395\nDoubt|3090|3262\nLoaded_Language|379|414\nLoaded_Language|516|541\nLoaded_Language|1227|1248\nDoubt|1703|1809\nDoubt|1845|1910\nLoaded_Language|2110|2135\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2439|2522\nDoubt|2951|3087\nLoaded_Language|3501|3507\nAppeal_to_Authority|3740|4317\nDoubt|4085|4285\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1153|1404\nDoubt|3824|3919\nLoaded_Language|3959|3966."}

{"prompt":"San Francisco Show Trial Sequel\n\nLast week, a San Francisco jury acquitted seven-time felon Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a repeatedly deported Mexican national, of all murder and manslaughter charges in the July 1, 2015, fatal shooting of Kate Steinle as she walked with her father and a friend on Pier 14.\nThe jury found the confessed shooter guilty only of felony gun possession.\nMany observers decried the verdict as a travesty of justice, but they were mistaken if they thought it could not get any worse.\nSan Francisco public defender Matt Gonzalez now seeks to have Zarate’s gun possession charge dismissed.\nGonzalez is contending the jury should have been told that “momentary” possession of a gun is not necessarily a crime.\n“If you possess it just to dispose of it or abandon it, it wouldn’t be a crime,” Gonzalez told reporters.\nThe Steinle family and relatives of murder victims have new cause for outrage, but this gambit is consistent with Gonzalez and the San Francisco show-trial in which he co-starred.\nGonzalez hails from McAllen, Texas, and attended Columbia University on a scholarship.\nAs he explained, “I think I was a product of affirmative action,” and ethnic preferences doubtless played a role in admission to Stanford Law School.\nIn San Francisco, Gonzalez became known as “The Great Left Hope,” and a hero to Bay Area radicals.\nThe La Raza Lawyers Association named Gonzalez Lawyer of the Year, and the Mexican American Political Association, a group with roots in the Communist Party, gave him the Bert Corona award, after one of the CPUSA’s most high-profile Stalinists.\nIn 2,000, after a decade as a public defender, Gonzalez gained election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\nIn 2003, as board president, he commissioned a graffiti artist to spray SMASH THE STATE on his office wall, in “traffic cone orange.” As Gonzalez explained, “This is a sentiment I think all of us have had.\nYou have to rally and find ways of opposing what you don’t like.”\nIn 2003 Gonzalez ran for mayor of San Francisco but lost to Gavin Newsom.\nIn 2008 Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader tapped Gonzalez for vice president.\n“He has a great, steadfast commitment to justice,” Nader told reporters.\nOn that score, the Steinle family and other relatives of murder victims have room for reasonable doubt.\nIn jury selection, Gonzalez and the prosecutor, assistant district attorney Diana Garcia, included three “immigrants,” quite possibly false-documented illegals.\nTrue to form, judge Samuel Feng sealed the identities of the jurors.\nSo observers have grounds to believe that Garcia and Gonzalez both got the jury they wanted.\nGarcia told the court Zarate was playing his own “secret version of Russian roulette,” and thus parroted the defense’s contention that the shooting was all a matter of chance.\nAs it happens, in Russian roulette a shooter loads one bullet into a six-shot revolver, spins the cylinder, then puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger.\nIn a central fact of the case, Zarate did not aim the gun at himself but fired in the direction of Kate Steinle.\nIn another established fact, the bullet struck her in the lower back and tore through her abdominal aorta.\nThis happened in broad daylight, but as in In the Heat of the Night, they had the body which was dead.\nGarcia Zarate confessed to firing the shot and had gunpowder residue on his hands.\nAfter firing, he tossed the gun in the water.\nHe said he had found the stolen weapon wrapped in a cloth and that it discharged by itself, both utterly unbelievable claims.\nEven so, the politically correct jury found the career criminal not guilty of murder and manslaughter.\nAny observer could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted.\nUnlike Stalin’s trials of the old Bolsheviks, and Fidel Castro’ trial of General Arnaldo Ochoa, this show trial aimed to establish innocence for the guilty, and the dynamics of the left were on full display.\nDenunciations of “gun violence” were nowhere in evidence and expressions of sympathy for the Steinle family proved pathetically weak.\nAs Arthur Koestler said, on the left the truth is spoken with loathing and falsehood with love.\nOn the left, as Orwell had it in Animal Farm, rats are comrades, and criminals are victims of capitalist society.\nIn the view of Gonzalez, society is progressing toward a social justice paradise ruled by a wise elite that knows what’s best for all.\nIn this inexorable progress, determined by history, some people are going to have to die.\nAs Bertolt Brecht told Sidney Hook about Stalin’s victims, “the more innocent they are, the more they deserve to be shot.”\nOut for a summer-day walk with her father and a friend, Kate Steinle was a completely innocent victim, gunned down by a career criminal who was not even supposed to be in the country but found special protection in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, part of the sanctuary state of California.\nAs defense attorney Francisco Ugarte said, the verdict was a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”\nSince Donald Trump mentioned the case, former vice-presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez had to establish the complete innocence of the shooter.\nThat explains the effort of “The Great Left Hope” to have his client’s felony gun possession conviction tossed.\nAny observer of the case could believe it probably will be.\n>","completion":"

is what we know:\nISIS has claimed responsibility for the Vegas slaughter.\nISIS does not claim credit for events that are not theirs.\nThey have double and tripled down on their claim.\nThey have said that Stephen Paddock had converted to Islam six months ago, and they revealed his Islamic name as Abu Abd Abdulbar al Ameriki.\nPaddock made multiple trips to the Middle East.\nThe FBI has not spoken of his itinerary or who he met with.\nHis girlfriend Mari Danley had relatives in Dubai.\nOver 200 of Paddock’s foreign financial transactions were flagged for possible covert terrorism financing.\nPaddock transferred $100,000 to his girlfriend in the Philippines, now an ISIS foothold.\nPaddock removed the hard drive before he committed suicide.\nThe San Bernardino jihad attackers did the same thing.\nIf you recall, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik threw their hard drives in a lake near their home, and despite Herculean efforts by law enforcement, the hard drives were never recovered.\nAUTHORITIES PUT BRAKES ON INFORMATION FLOW IN LAS VEGAS SHOOTING By Rachel Crosby Las Vegas Review-Journal, October 26, 2017: Fifty-eight people killed.\nMore than 500 injured.\nAnd yet, nearly a month after the Las Vegas Strip experienced the worst mass shooting in modern American history, local and federal authorities are refusing to fill in the blanks.\nIt wasn’t always like this.\nIn the days after Oct. 1, when Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest festival crowd from his Mandalay Bay corner suite, Las Vegas police were hosting multiple news conferences a day.\nThen, once a day.\nThen, once every few days.\nThey compiled and released snippets of officers’ body camera footage.\nThey spent several minutes answering specific questions.\nThey released a comprehensive timeline, which ended up being wrong.\nThey took it back, and tried to clarify the errors, but instead caused more confusion.\nBy Oct. 13 — the last time the Metropolitan Police Department or the FBI addressed the media or public — something had changed.\nThe sheriff, who had been straightforward and stern, was now emotional and at times combative.\nBoth he and the FBI failed to provide much new information, and at the end of the meeting, they refused to take questions.\nSince that day, the only person who has shed more light on the investigation is Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, who was shot in the leg while approaching the gunman’s room.\nHis platform to share that information?\n“The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” which aired last week.\nHe hasn’t made himself available to the media since.\n“It doesn’t matter,” FBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Thursday, when asked why there had been no significant updates in two weeks.\n“It’s an ongoing investigation, and unless there’s something to report, there will not be a briefing.” Calls to the national FBI office were forwarded back to Breault at the Las Vegas office.\nAt least twice this week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal has asked to speak with Sheriff Joe Lombardo about the shooting investigation.\nBoth times, reporters were told by Carla Alston, the Police Department’s director of communications, that the sheriff “will not be conducting interviews.” “As he has stated previously, the case is still ongoing” she said in an email Thursday.\n“Another media briefing will be held when we have new and accurate information.” When asked when that briefing would be, Alston guessed it could occur in the next two weeks.\nThe Review-Journal also specifically asked about the more than 50,000 hours of overtime that Metro officers have logged since Oct. 1 on work directly related to the shooting investigation.\n“Investigators have made progress on investigative leads and in mapping out Stephen Paddock’s life for the last few years — and they’re still not done,” Alston said.\n“We still have officers dedicated to this case 24\/7.” She agreed that members of the public have a right to know more, “but they have a right to accurate information and not the speculation … that has filled so many news stories the past month.” Nearly a month after the mass shooting, the gunman’s motive remains a mystery.\nMore straightforward questions also remain unanswered, including whether the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay — where the gunman was staying — has surveillance cameras, and what exactly investigators collected in the gunman’s hotel room and homes.\nAuthorities also have not said how long the gunman had a “do not disturb” sign on his hotel door, and whether hotel staff saw something suspicious in his room but failed to report it.\nThough authorities have described the investigation as a team effort, they have not explained what role Las Vegas police, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are playing in the case.\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller.\nPamela Geller's commitment to freedom

{"prompt":"﻿Communion to Adulterers Promulgated as \"Authentic Magisterium\"\n\nLast week, Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS)—the Vatican's organ for promulgating the Official Acts of the Apostolic See—published Pope Francis' October 2016 letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires in which he praised their episcopal guidelines allowing divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion in some cases while living in a state of objective mortal sin.\nIf papal clarification was ever needed on the long-debated issue of the intended meaning of Amoris Laetitia chapter VIII, such clarification has now been provided for the Church at large.\nConcerning these guidelines that allow \"the possibility of access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist\" in \"complex circumstances\" where \"limitations that lessen the responsibility and guilt\" permit adulterous couples to continue in adultery, the pope said in his letter:\n\"The document is very good and completely explains the meaning of chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia.\nThere are no other interpretations.\"\nUntil now, the pope's letter to the Argentinian bishops had been considered a private letter with no binding force, whereas AAS has now elevated Pope Francis' letter to the official magisterial status of an \"Apostolic Letter,\" while including a special rescript as an addendum by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State.\nThe rescript declares that Pope Francis expressly intends both documents—the papal letter and the episcopal guidelines—to bear the character of his \"authentic Magisterium,\" and that the pope has personally ordered their publication in AAS and on the Vatican website.\nHence Amoris Laetitia VIII, which proposes that people living in adultery can be guiltless and thus be admitted to the sacraments of Confession and Communion when \"concrete circumstances\" make it difficult to renounce their adulterous state, is now declared \"magisterial\" by the Holy See.\nThe problem with this is that heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial, so that if it is, it not only has no binding force, but the faithful are obliged to resist and refute such a declaration.\nSt. Thomas Aquinas says in his Summa Theologiae: \"If the faith were endangered, a subject ought to rebuke his prelate [pope] even publicly.\"\nThe fact is that this latest promulgation is counter-magisterial, but the pope and his right-hand man now feel they have enough support from the dissenting left that enables them to come forward with it.\nCardinal Parolin's rescript on the papal and episcopal documents reads as follows:\nRescript \"from an Audience with His Holiness\"\nThe Supreme Pontiff decreed that the two preceding documents be promulgated through publication on the Vatican website and in Acta Apostolicae Sedis, as authentic Magisterium.\nFrom the Vatican Palace, on the day of June 5 in the year 2017\nPietro Card.\nParolin\nSecretary of State\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia defines a papal rescript as follows: \"Rescripts are responses of the pope or a Sacred Congregation, in writing, to queries or petitions of individuals.\nSome rescripts concern the granting of favors; others the administration of justice, e.g.\nthe interpretation of a law.\"\nIt appears then that Parolin's rescript constitutes a direct reply to the dubia of the Four Cardinals.\nPope Francis' praise of the episcopal guidelines clearly answers the cardinals' query concerning his intention in Amoris Laetitia VIII, so will Cardinals Brandmuller and Burke now proceed to issue the formal correction of it?\nAs reported in The Dictator Pope—a remarkable new book which provides an inside look at the most tyrannical and unprincipled papacy of recent history—English Cardinal Cormac Murphy O’Connor who was largely responsible for the vote canvassing behind Francis' election told journalist Paul Valley in 2013, \"Four years of Bergoglio would be enough to change things.\"\nEach day, we see new evidence that this might have been a gross understatement.\nWe shouldn't rule out the possibility that Francis may come forward one day and declare \"ex-cathedra\" that the interpretation of Amoris Laetitia VIII, as now taught by the Holy See, is promulgated as \"extraordinary magisterium.\"\nShould this happen, the Mystical Body would then be without its head.\nIn an interview with Catholic World Report (CWR) in December 2016, Cardinal Raymond Burke, who is presently a member of the Apostolic Signatura, said that if a pope were to \"formally profess heresy he would cease, by that act, to be the Pope.\"\nBurke was reiterating Church teaching, as expressed by famed canonist Franz Wernz in his Ius Canonicum: \"In sum, it needs to be said clearly that a [publicly] heretical Roman Pontiff loses his power upon the very fact.\"\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|3611|3673\nLoaded_Language|3943|3965\nLoaded_Language|4216|4264\nAppeal_to_Authority|919|1054."}

{"prompt":"Our New Muslim Representatives\n\nAs expected, two Muslim women, Rashida Tlaib in Michigan and Ilhan Omar in Minnesota, have been overwhelmingly elected to Congress.\nThe establishment media will celebrate these victories as triumphs of America’s “diversity”; unfortunately, in reality neither one is worth celebrating.\nTlaib is a vociferous foe of Israel.\nWith the Democrats now regaining control of the House, Tlaib is likely to be an energetic proponent of the new majority’s vendetta against the Middle East’s only democracy.\nThe House is likely to do all it can to roll back President Trump’s pro-Israel polices, with Tlaib as well as Omar as becoming the public faces of the effort.\nAccording to the JTA, when Tlaib was asked if she would vote against military aid to Israel, Tlaib responded: “Absolutely, if it has something to do with inequality and not access to people having justice.\nFor me, U.S. aid should be leverage.\nI will be using my position in Congress so that no country, not one, should be able to get aid from the U.S. when they still promote that kind of injustice.”\nWhat kind of injustice?\nTlaib, of course, had nothing to say about the genocidal incitement against Jews and Israel that regularly features on Palestinian television.\nShe did say, however, that she favors a one-state, not two-state, “solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: “One state.\nIt has to be one state.\nSeparate but equal does not work.\nI’m only 42 years old but my teachers were of that generation that marched with Martin Luther King.\nThis whole idea of a two-state solution, it doesn’t work.”\nIndeed it doesn’t.\nA Palestinian state would be a new base for renewed jihad attacks against Israel.\nBut a “one-state solution” would be even worse, unless that state is the current State of Israel, but that is not the one state Tlaib has in mind.\nShe is calling for an Israeli\/Palestinian state that would not be a Jewish State or a homeland for the Jewish people, but a federation in which Palestinians would soon overwhelm Jews demographically.\nProgressive denial of their rights would soon follow: as I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS, there has never been a majority Muslim nation in which Jews enjoyed equality of rights with Muslims.\nTlaib’s unitary state would be no different.\nThe hijabed (and therefore pro-Sharia) Ilhan Omar, meanwhile, is even more hateful than Tlaib.\nAccording to the Daily Wire, in 2012 Omar tweeted: “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.\n#Gaza #Palestine #Israel.” Challenged about this tweet much more recently, she doubled down and attacked the man who called attention to the tweet: “Drawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating Jews.\nYou are a hateful sad man, I pray to Allah you get the help you need and find happiness.”\nThere is much, much worse about Omar.\nDavid Steinberg of PJ Media has done extraordinary work in shedding light on aspects of Omar’s record that the establishment media has steadfastly ignored.\nSteinberg reports that Omar has “faced allegations -- soon backed by a remarkable amount of evidence -- that she had married her own brother in 2009, and was still legally his wife.\nThey officially divorced in December 2017.\nThe motivation for the marriage remains unclear.\nHowever, the totality of the evidence points to possible immigration fraud and student loan fraud.” What’s more, she swore to apparent falsehoods in court.\nBut Leftists rarely have to answer for their corruption, and in a Democrat House, Omar will much more likely be celebrated than investigated.\nShe and Tlaib will enjoy establishment media accolades as they pursue their hard-Left, anti-American, anti-Israel agenda.\nTheir presence in the House of Representatives may be evidence of “diversity,” but it is also a disquieting sign of the continued dominance of identity politics, and the increasing balkanization of the American body politic.\nForthrightly pro-America, pro-Israel candidates would stand little to no chance in either of their districts.\nAnd that is indicative of a much larger problem.\n>","completion":" Whataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|1111|1252\nExaggeration,Minimisation|118|150\nDoubt|257|315\nLoaded_Language|476|492\nExaggeration,Minimisation|977|996\nRepetition|1579|1594\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2372|2403\nLoaded_Language|2468|2478\nLoaded_Language|2536|2561\nLoaded_Language|2638|2667\nDoubt|2787|2874\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2877|2913\nLoaded_Language|3931|3959\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|3990|4147\nLoaded_Language|128|142\nFlag-Waving|222|254\nFlag-Waving|892|1084\nName_Calling,Labeling|2795|2812\nLoaded_Language|2952|2970\nLoaded_Language|3050|3069."}

{"prompt":"Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence\n\nHomeschooling rates are skyrocketing as parents are continually getting more and more upset at the leftist social engineering taking place in public schools.\nThe indoctrination is getting so bad, that some parents are even concerned about liberal violence against those who reject the brainwashing.\nAccording to The Washington Times, the recent school shooting at Parkland, Florida, was the last straw for scores of parents.\nThe paper noted that “the phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven’t stopped yet.”\n“When the Parkland shooting happened, our phone calls and emails exploded,” said coalition president Tim Lambert.\n“In the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled.\nWe’re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month, and prior to that it was 600 to 700.” But according to Natural News, it isn’t just the rampant violence worrying some parents.\nThat’s just the tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg.\nChristopher Chin, head of Homeschool Louisiana, told The Times that parents are fed up with “the violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments.” Many parents are also disturbed by the social engineering, which amounts to brainwashing and indoctrination that goes on in a public school.\nFor example, a Minnesota public school is forcing Kindergarten students to study ‘white privilege’.\nThe left-wing curriculum and common core are also driving parents to remove their children from public schools.\nBrian D. Ray, who heads up the National Home Education Research Institute, in Salem, Oregon, who’s conducted homeschooling research for 33 years, told The Times that concern over school curriculum has reached the top of the charts for most parents.\nRay said the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment.\nSince teachers are not allowed to arm themselves to defend their students against the violence often perpetrated at schools simply because they are gun free zones, homeschooling takes care of that problem.\n“Most parents homeschool for more than one reason,” Ray told the paper.\n“But when we ask families why do they homeschool, near the top nowadays is concern about the environment of schools, and that includes safety, pressure to get into drugs, pressure to get into sexual activity.\nIt includes all of that.”\nIndoctrination means to teach a person to accept a belief uncritically.\nIt’s the very reason the governments of the world still exist.\nPeople cannot logically and critically understand that hurting people and taking their things is wrong – even if people who declare themselves government is the one doing it.\nGovernments are nothing more than a handful of people and have no right to aggress against others.\nBut humans are taught at a young age to never question this and that belief has kept most of humanity enslaved for centuries.\n﻿\nIt isn’t a surprise that so many have decided to educate their children themselves.\nAnd as schools continue to fail, and authoritarian policies continue to wreak havoc on our society, more will wake up to the absolute horror of what allowing the state to educate our children has done to the moral fabric of humanity.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|371|383\nLoaded_Language|965|981\nLoaded_Language|3326|3341\nLoaded_Language|76|84\nLoaded_Language|110|122\nLoaded_Language|274|280\nLoaded_Language|1172|1180\nLoaded_Language|1391|1398\nLoaded_Language|3091|3099\nLoaded_Language|3238|3251\nLoaded_Language|3273|3284\nLoaded_Language|1230|1239\nRepetition|1284|1296\nRepetition|2153|2161\nRepetition|2420|2427\nRepetition|1727|1734\nRepetition|309|318\nRepetition|248|262\nRepetition|1301|1315\nRepetition|2580|2594\nRepetition|333|341\nRepetition|973|981\nRepetition|1158|1166\nRepetition|1247|1265\nCausal_Oversimplification|2652|2713\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2890|2943\nExaggeration,Minimisation|692|700\nFlag-Waving|3288|3299\nName_Calling,Labeling|185|211."}

{"prompt":"'Textbook Definition of Bias'\n\nOn Monday, DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified with FBI boss Christopher Wray before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nIn a predictable performance, the duo cited mistakes and raised concerns but solved none of the lingering mysteries the massive report released last week that found anti-Trump bias did not affect FBI and DOJ decisions.\nOn Tuesday Horowitz performed solo before a joint session of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees.\nOversight chairman Trey Gowdy delivered the opening statement.\nThe attorney general had been accused of “softening or watering down his report,” Gowdy said, “When the reality is it was Jim Comey who softened and watered down his press release, announcing no charges against Secretary Clinton.\nWe see Jim Comey and Jim Comey alone deciding which DOJ policies to follow and which to ignore, to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to support each and every element of an offense and we see Jim Comey and Jim Comey alone deciding whether to send a letter to Congress in the throes of looming election.”\nIn a devastating exchange with Horowitz, Gowdy said that “prejudging the outcome of an investigation before it ends, and prejudging the outcome of an investigation before it begins” is the “textbook definition of bias.” Democrats echoed the IG report’s conclusion that there was no bias.\nRepublicans sought to tie up some loose threads.\nThe IG report confirmed that President Obama communicated with Hillary Clinton on her unsecured email system.\nHorowitz said the president had been one of 13 who had done so.\nRep. Steve King asked about the volume of communications between the president and Clinton.\n“I’ll have to get back to you on that,” Horowitz said, and the IG was “not sure” if any of the communications had involved classified or top secret material.\nIf the IG did know the subject of the president’s communications with Clinton, he failed to reveal any details.\nHorowitz “would have to ask” if his team interviewed any officials at the Obama White House but said “not the president himself.”\nRep. King asked Horowitz about his first encounter with the switch of “extremely careless” for ‘gross negligence,” which violated a criminal statute.\nHorowitz found that Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and James Comey were all involved.\nThe IG also said his team focused on the fact that the classified material on Clinton’s server was “not clearly marked,” which repeated one of Clinton’s claims about her negligence.\nAs for the question of her “intent,” Horowitz said it arose “months earlier,” maybe in 2015, though he couldn’t be sure.\nKing said President Obama had suggested the “careless but not intentional” language in a “60 Minutes” appearance in October of 2015.\nAnd King had observed that in his July 5, 2016 statement, James Comey used “intent” six times.\nHorowitz said Comey “concealed from the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, his intention to make a unilateral announcement in July 2016 about the reasons for his recommendations not to prosecute former Secretary Clinton.” The IG also described his report as a “thorough, comprehensive and objective recitation of the facts.”\nThe IG did confirm that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page worked on the Clinton investigation, the Russia and the Mueller team.\nHorowitz said Strzok and Page had exchanged “tens of thousands of texts.” Ohio Rep. James Jordan asked Horowitz when his team had discovered the message about “we’ll stop” Trump.\nHorowitz conceded that this meant “stop Trump from becoming president.” The IG said they uncovered that text in May, and Jordan asked “why did we not see it until last Thursday?”\n“I can’t answer that,” Horowitz said, adding that it had been sent to Rod Rosenstein’s department at the DOJ.\nJordan concluded that Rosenstein “made the decision that we had to wait a month.”\nSeveral representatives were curious about two FBI agents and one lawyer the IG report had not named.\n“The FBI raised a concern because they work on counterintelligence matters,” Horowitz said.\nRep Mark Meadows asked if the two FBI agents were Kevin Clinesmith and Sally Moyer, which the IG declined to confirm.\n“They don’t work in counterintelligence,” said Meadows, who charged that the FBI gave the IG “false information” and altered key witness reports.\n“How did Comey see the report before it came out?” Rep. Darrell Issa wanted to know.\nHorowitz said Comey didn’t see the whole thing, but explained that he allowed those the IG team had criticized to have a look before release.\nBy the end of the day it was evident that Congress would have to hear from Comey, Rosenstein, Strzok and others.\nHorowitz confirmed that the IG is investigating whether FBI official Peter Strzok’s anti-Trump bias factored into the launch of the bureau’s Russia probe.\nAlso on Tuesday Peter Strzok was “escorted” from the FBI building.\nAs his lawyer told reporters, Strzok had “played by the rules,” but been targeted by “unfounded personal attacks, political games and inappropriate information leaks.”\n“I hope he comes and portrays himself as a victim,” Trey Gowdy told Fox News.\nRep. Bob Goodlatte said the committee would issue a subpoena for Strzok to testify “next week.”\nThat will make for an exciting show on C-SPAN but none of this would be happening if the deep state plot to “stop” Trump had succeeded.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|2168|2186\nLoaded_Language|787|816\nRepetition|982|1011\nLoaded_Language|1099|1110\nLoaded_Language|2193|2209\nLoaded_Language|5320|5335\nRepetition|2497|2507."}
{"prompt":"An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University\n\n​Despite suffering several public and humiliating reversals in various forums and venues, those pushing for boycotts, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against Israel have not dispensed with their pernicious campaign of hate.\nThe latest outrage perpetrated by BDS activists occurred at McGill University, where a Jewish student and two non-Jewish students identified as pro-Israel were removed from their positions as directors of the Students Society of McGill University (SSMU).\nAt the end of his second year, Noah Lew, who is currently third year undergraduate student at McGill University, applied to serve as Director of the School’s student society.\nHe was warned by others who had prior dealings with the SSMU, to keep his Jewish identity secret lest he sabotage his chances.\nThis is the atmosphere that Jewish students and supporters of Israel must endure on a daily basis at McGill.\nThe toxic environment is due almost exclusively to an active and vocal presence of BDS agitators on campus.\nLew followed the advice and was elected as a board member.\nHis “secret” was intact.\nBDS provocateurs at McGill had relentlessly tried and failed to pass boycott resolutions against Israel.\nIn fact, three attempts within an 18-month period were quashed.\nFinally, in June 2016, SSMU’s Judicial Board ruled that the BDS campaign and efforts to institute it at McGill ran counter to the McGill’s undergraduate student union constitution.\nThe Board’s ruling, which is called a “reference,” was then referred to SSMU’s directors for ratification.\nSSMU’s Board of Directors addressed the issue more than a year after the “reference.” Lew and other board members passionately advocated in favor of ratification and their arguments ultimately prevailed over the naysayers.\nThe malevolent BDS campaign at McGill had belatedly come to an ignominious end; or so we thought.\nLew and two other directors identified as either Jewish or pro-Israel became instant targets of a campaign of hate laced with blatant anti-Semitic overtones.\nCampus BDS groups held several meetings to formulate a response and founded the so-called “Democratize SSMU” movement.\nBut Democratize SSMU was anything but democratic.\nIts raison d'être was to seek the removal of Jewish and anti-BDS students from SSMU’s Board of Directors and place BDS back on the agenda.\nAs an aside, one of the more vocal proponents of BDS at McGill is a rancid character named Igor Sadikov, who in February posted a comment on twitter advocating violence against “Zionists.” As a result, he was forced to resign his position as an SSMU director but dodged an impeachment effort to have him stripped of his position at McGill’s Arts Undergraduate Society.\nSadikov made light of his “punch a Zionist” tweet calling it a “misguided joke.” It does not appear that Sadikov was subjected to any form of school disciplinary action despite the fact that his call for violence violated McGill’s Code of Conduct.\nMcGill’s BDS Action Network actively campaigned against Lew and two other board members because of their links to Jewish groups and anti-BDS stances.\nDemocratize SSMU shamefully highlighted Lew’s ethnicity as a reason for his removal.\nAn enlightened, progressive school was suddenly transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws.\nIn October, SSMU’s General Assembly moved to ratify the 12-member Board of Directors.\nAccording to Lew, “historically, the Board of Directors had been ratified as a bloc, all 12 at a time.” But BDS activists who showed up for the General Assembly ratification forced the voting to occur on an individual basis rather than a block as was the accepted protocol.\nIn this manner, BDS\/ Democratize SSMU activists managed to pick off their opponents one at a time.\nIt was repulsive display leftist-fascist bigotry at its worst.\nThe bigoted BDS provocateurs applauded as Lew and the other two board members were removed from their posts.\nBut this time, they may have gone too far.\nEven by BDS standards, their manifestly anti-Semitic campaign antics were beyond the pale.\nBDS activists generally avoid reference to “Jews” by name because it is impolitic and commonly substitute “Zionists” for Jews even though most of us are cognizant of their true intentions.\nBut in the instant case, McGill’s BDS campaigners dispensed with their traditional charade and overtly launched their attack against Jews.\nThe vitriolic BDS campaign immediately sparked outrage among watchdog groups and politicians prompting McGill principal, Suzanne Fortier, to announce that the school would be conducting an investigation into the matter.\nEven SSMU president, Muna Tojiboeva, voiced support for Lew and expressed the belief that antisemitism played a key role in the ousting the three board members.\nOne can only hope that Fortier takes the issue seriously and conducts a proper investigation, which leads to disciplinary action.\nJudging by past “investigations” conducted by other schools – SFSU, CUNY and UCI, to name a few – I am not optimistic.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|238|265\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1999|2059\nLoaded_Language|2802|2816\nLoaded_Language|71|103\nLoaded_Language|278|285\nLoaded_Language|933|954\nName_Calling,Labeling|1016|1029\nName_Calling,Labeling|1125|1141\nLoaded_Language|1280|1292\nName_Calling,Labeling|1805|1832\nDoubt|2180|2228\nSlogans|2765|2780\nLoaded_Language|3153|3163\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3827|3881\nName_Calling,Labeling|3883|3911\nRepetition|3895|3911\nExaggeration,Minimisation|4058|4124\nName_Calling,Labeling|4064|4103\nName_Calling,Labeling|4454|4480\nLoaded_Language|4493|4508\nDoubt|4965|5082\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|697|822\nLoaded_Language|1696|1718\nLoaded_Language|1868|1883\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|3221|3359\nLoaded_Language|4398|4405."}

{"prompt":"Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically\n\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump continued bashing Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia investigation, saying cryptically Monday the special counsel is “looking for trouble.”\nTrump alleged in a morning tweet series that the former FBI director is “Disgraced and discredited,” claiming his staff amounts to nothing more than a “group of Angry Democrat Thugs.”\nThat came hours after a Sunday tweet in which he referred to the special counsel team as a “gang.” Both are words with loaded meanings for his conservative political base.\nThe president’s Sunday and Monday attacks on Mueller and his team came after reports that White House Counsel Donald McGahn was interviewed by Mueller and his team for more than one full day.\nTrump contends he signed off on the testimony; George W. Bush-era White House counsel and attorney general Alberto Gonzales, however, told CNN Monday morning that a sitting White House counsel would be required to fully cooperate with a federal investigation because he is a government lawyer, not a president’s personal attorney.\nBut Trump on Monday morning tweeted that McGahn spoke with the special counsel team for “over 30 hours with the White House Councel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency.” (The tweet included a misspelling of “counsel.”)\nThe length of the Mueller-McGahn sessions led Trump to the conclusion the special counsel is “looking for trouble” because they “they know there is no Russian Collusion.”\nBut Mueller reportedly is keenly interested in a widely studied June 2016 Trump Tower meeting arranged by Donald Trump Jr., which included a Russian attorney who promised to hand over negative information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\nThe session also was attended by then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner; the president dictated a misleading statement about it a year later and it remains murky just when he learned about the meeting.\nAs Roll Call has reported, Trump was in the tower at the time of the session with the Russian lawyer.\nThe president also continued to push a line first floated by his attorney, former New York mayor and U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani, tweeting that campaign collusion with Russia would be a “phony crime.” He’s right, there is no specific collusion statute.\nBut legal experts say anyone in Trump’s orbit would be charged with conspiracy, making false statements to federal investigators or obstructing justice.\nAll are federal crimes.\nTrump also continued to cast himself as a victim in the matter, saying when he attempts to “FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt,” his critics “scream Obstruction!”\nMueller also is looking at whether some of Trump’s actions like firing then-FBI Director James B.

{"prompt":"German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’\n\nNewsCatholic Church\nGERMANY, February 8, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Cardinal Paul Josef Cordes criticized fellow German Cardinal Reinhard Marx’s suggestion that Catholic priests should consider “blessing” same-sex relationships liturgically.\nMarx’s idea “truly seems sacrilegious” and “ignores the clear Revelation of God,” Cordes wrote in a response on kath.net.\nDr. Maike Hickson translated it at One Peter Five.\n“The Church is in its pastoral care bound to Holy Scripture and to its interpretation through the Church’s Magisterium,” wrote Cordes.\n“Marx does not even mention that homosexuality always contradicts the Will of God,” citing church teaching through the centuries.\nRather than being about receiving “God’s assistance for themselves,” those engaging in sodomy and wishing to have it “blessed” by the Church “aim with their request at the recognition and acceptance of their homosexual way of life and its ecclesial valorization.”\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that “under no circumstances” can homosexual activity “be approved” as it is “intrinsically disordered.” Such acts are “contrary to the natural law.\nThey close the sexual act to the gift of life.\nThey do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity” (CCC 2357).\nHowever, Marx said on February 3 that homosexual couples need “closer pastoral care” and “one must also encourage priests and pastoral workers to give people in concrete situations [of homosexual unions] encouragement.\nI do not really see any problems there.”\nMarx is the President of the German Bishops’ Conference.\nAs LifeSiteNews previously reported, Marx also said “yes,” he could imagine the creation of a rite for homosexual couples to be blessed in the Church.\nThis “encouragement” from priests which he called for might include some sort of “liturgical” recognition of their union.\nBut “how this would be done publicly, in a liturgical form,” is “another question...that is where one has to be reticent and also reflect upon that in a good way.”\nAfter Catholic News Agency’s initial report on Marx’s comments, his office contacted the outlet and said they had mistranslated part of what he said.\nThe cardinal’s office sent CNA “a request for correction of [its] translation of the interview in question, expressing concern that CNA's translation constitutes a false reference and does not properly reflect the position of Cardinal Marx.”\nThe cardinal’s office maintains that rather than saying “yes,” there is a possibility of liturgical “blessing” of gay unions, he answered the question in a more subtle way without giving an explicit “yes.” However, the German Bishops’ Conference doesn’t seem to deny the rest of his statements on how “one must encourage priests” to give encouragement to homosexual couples, which could include public blessings that would take a “liturgical” form.\nThe cardinal’s staff asked that CNA change his answer about liturgically “blessing” gay unions to: “There are no general solutions and I think that would not be right, because we are talking about pastoral care for individual cases, and that applies to other areas as well, which we cannot regulate, where we have no sets of rules.”\nPhiladelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput has also spoken out against Marx’s proposal.\n“Any such ‘blessing rite’ would cooperate in a morally forbidden act, no matter how sincere the persons seeking the blessing,” wrote Chaput.\nHe explained such a “blessing” would encourage people to continue living in a way the Church considers gravely sinful and spiritually damaging, and therefore would be uncharitable.\n“There is no love – no charity – without truth, just as there is no real mercy separated from a framework of justice informed and guided by truth,” he wrote.\n“Creating confusion around important truths of our faith, no matter how positive the intention, only makes a difficult task more difficult.”\n“There are two principles we need to remember,” Chaput wrote.\n“First, we need to treat all people with the respect and pastoral concern they deserve as children of God with inherent dignity.\nThis emphatically includes persons with same-sex attraction.\nSecond, there is no truth, no real mercy, and no authentic compassion, in blessing a course of action that leads persons away from God.”\n“This in no way is a rejection of the persons seeking such a blessing, but rather a refusal to ignore what we know to be true about the nature of marriage, the family, and the dignity of human sexuality,” he explained.\n“Jesus said the truth will make us free.\nNowhere did he suggest it will make us comfortable.”\nCordes has a history of defending the Church’s moral teaching.\nMarx, one of the pope’s nine main advisors, said in 2016 that same-sex relationships have “worth” which must be recognized by the Church.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study\n\nScientists say our Sun will likely enter a cooldown cycle as soon as 2050, but the phase has almost no effect on global warming.\nPhysicist Dan Lubin at the University of California San Diego and two of his colleges managed to collect and observe relevant data for the past 20 years and came to the conclusion that the giant burning ball of gas in our planetary system might enter a “grand minimum” period of decreased ultraviolet radiation that would last for some 11 years by mid-century.\n“The cooldown… [is] a periodic event during which the Sun’s magnetism diminishes, sunspots form infrequently, and less ultraviolet radiation (UV) makes it to the surface of the planet,” researchers noted in a statement earlier this week, adding that “the event is triggered at irregular intervals by random fluctuations related to the Sun’s magnetic field.”\nThe study, whose results were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said the Sun is likely to be 6.9 percent cooler than its usual lowest amount of activity in the grand minimum.\nAccording to the researchers, the cooldown phase could echo those experienced in Europe in the mid-17th century, called the “Maunder Minimum,” or the prolonged sunspot minimum, during which temperatures were low enough to cause London's River Thames to freeze over on a regular basis and to freeze the Baltic Sea to such an extent that Swedish troops were able to invade Denmark in 1658 on foot by marching across the sea ice.\nHowever, scientists warned that it should not be assumed that the ultra-cooling of the sun would potentially prevent the negative effects of global warming.\n“The cooling effect of a grand minimum is only a fraction of the warming effect caused by the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,” they said, adding, “After hundreds of thousands of years of CO2 levels never exceeding 300 parts per million in air, the concentration of the greenhouse gas is now over 400 parts per million, continuing a rise that began with the Industrial Revolution.”\nThe study estimated that the Sun’s mid-century cooldown would probably only result in cooling the Earth by some 0.25 percent between 2020 and 2070.\nAs a result, the temperature at the surface of our cosmic home would decrease by up to several tenths of a degree Celsius, which is not sufficient to stop global warming, but it could at least soften its effects in part.\n“Now we have a benchmark from which we can perform better climate model simulations.\nWe can therefore have a better idea of how changes in solar UV radiation affect climate change,” said Lubin.\n>","completion":" no propaganda found."}

{"prompt":"Black Death: ‘It’s 100 % Likely’ It Spreads To The UK And A ‘Ticking Time Bomb’ Ready To Decimate The World\n\nThe death toll in Madagascar due to the plague has jumped for the first time since health officials claimed the infection was in the beginning stages of control.\nWith the new uptick in those who died, the fear that the disease will spread to the United Kingdom has been confirmed as “100 percent likely.”\nThe plague death toll has now shown signs that it’s picking up speed again.\nOfficial figures reveal 165 people have now lost their lives in Madagascar’s “worst outbreak in 50 years.” Recent data shows a 15 percent jump in fatalities over just three days, coupled with scientists concerned that the black death has reached a “crisis” point.\nTen other African countries have also been placed on high alert, warning that an outbreak could occur at any time.\nAt least 2,034 people have been infected down by a more lethal form of the black death so far in the country, which lies off the coast of Africa, according to WHO statistics.\nSome experts fear the disease (which is so deadly because it is airborne) could mutate and become untreatable during this year’s outbreak – which is expected to blight Madagascar until April.\nOthers worry the plague will go beyond mainland Africa and eventually reach the US, Europe, and Britain.\nThe plague spreads easily and can kill within 48 hours.\nThat would leave millions more vulnerable to the outbreak, and create a short supply of life-saving antibiotics.\nAccording to the Daily Mail, experts warn the outbreak of plague in Madagascar this year is being fueled by a strain more lethal than the one which usually strikes the country.\nThis form of the pneumonic plague is airborne, easily spread by a cough or a sneeze, and has been responsible for two-thirds of all infections this year.\nThe bubonic form of the plague, responsible for the “Black Death” in the 14th century strikes the country each year and infects around 600 people.\nBut with over 2000 alread infected by pneumonic plague (and counting) health officials aren’t willing to quit sounding alarms just yet.\nPaul Hunter, a professor of health protection at the world-renowned University of East Anglia, was the first expert to predict the plague could travel across the sea.\nHe previously said: “The big anxiety is it could spread to mainland Africa, it’s not probable, but certainly possible, that might then be difficult to control.\nIf we don’t carry on doing stuff here, at one point something will happen and it will get out of our control and cause huge devastation all around the world.” There is always a risk with travel that the disease will spread globally, Hunter added.\n“We don’t want a situation where the disease spreads so fast it gets out of control.\nWe are talking about it spreading in days rather than weeks.” But Hunter is adamant that a well-developed country could manage the plague should a global outbreak occur.\nHopefully, most will never have to find out how well another country can manage this infection.\nA few health experts have warned that there is no threat to the UK, however, some have warned the plague outbreak will certainly spread to the region.\nRichard Conroy, the founder of Sick Holiday, has sent a chilling warning to UK authorities.\nConway is saying it’s “only a matter of time” before the disease arrives on British soil.\nConroy warned it is inevitable that the plague will spread due to the vast movement of people across the globe.\n“I believe that it’s 100 percent likely that plague will arrive in the UK once more – it’s just a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’.\nAnd it’s not an exaggeration to say that this is a real threat – a ticking time bomb that’s waiting to decimate the world,” Conroy continued.\n“With the current outbreak still remaining treatable with antibiotics, however, the current risk is low.”\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|58|107\nAppeal_to_Authority|567|596\nLoaded_Language|807|817\nAppeal_to_Authority|1118|1153\nName_Calling,Labeling|1893|1906\nAppeal_to_Authority|3126|3198\nLoaded_Language|3256|3272\nAppeal_to_Authority|3494|3577\nRepetition|3302|3380\nRepetition|3389|3440\nRepetition|3494|3620\nName_Calling,Labeling|0|11\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|819|867\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1049|1061\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1249|1274\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1408|1481\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|2451|2607\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|2654|2682\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|3580|3620\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|3687|3743."}

{"prompt":"Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’\n\nNewsCatholic Church\nBRATISLAVA, Slovakia, February 13, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Former Vatican doctrine chief Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller has decried the Church's current adaptation to the modern world and rejected the idea of blessing homosexual couples.\nThe remarks, made in a February 6 talk in Slovakia, indirectly respond to new initiatives coming from Germany, especially from Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode.\nCardinal Müller, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, spoke at a conference on John Paul II's encyclical Veritatis Splendor at the Comenius University in Bratislava, organized by the Slovakian Bishops' Conference.\nIn remarks after his address, reported by the German Catholic newspaper Die Tagespost, the cardinal made it clear what he thinks about the recently presented German idea of blessing homosexual unions, even if only in individual cases: “If a priest blesses a homosexual couple, then this is an atrocity at a holy site, namely, to approve of something that God does not approve of.”\nAccording to the Tagespost report, Cardinal Müller said in his address that he regrets the separation of the Church's doctrinal and moral teaching and called Christianity a “theocentric humanism.” He said the “submissive change of the Church into a NGO for the embetterment of the this-worldly life conditions” is a “suicidal modernization” that denies mankind the Truth of God.\nIn this context, the German cardinal also criticized Martin Luther's own denial of man's free will and his teaching about the total depravity of man that separates morality from the relationship with God.\nMorality, Müller explained, is rooted in Grace; that is why any teaching about “rules and exceptions” ignores the character of the ethics of the Covenant and of Grace.\nIn the discussion following his talk, Cardinal Müller also responded to questions concerning Pope Francis' post-synodal exhortation, Amoris Laetitia.\nThe cardinal said that he is “not happy” about the fact that there are different interpretations of this papal text by some bishops' conferences.\n“In dogmatic questions, there cannot be a plurality,” he added.\nThere is only one Magisterium, he said, and bishops' conferences can only decide about pastoral questions.\nContradictory conceptions concerning the Sacraments, said the cardinal, lead into chaotic conditions.\nThus, explained the cardinal, the Sacraments have to be celebrated the way Christ Himself willed it when he instituted them.\nThe controversial eighth chapter of Amoris Laetitia has to be understood “in an orthodox way,” namely that “he who lives in the state of mortal sin cannot receive Holy Communion.” It is, in Müller's eyes, the pope's duty “to unite the Church, that is what the pope is there for.” This is what he, Müller, himself told the pope: when the bishops' conferences present different interpretations of Amoris Laetitia, the Church enters “into a situation like the one before the Reformation.”\nArchbishop Stanislav Zvolensy, President of the Slovakian Bishops' Conference and archbishop of Bratislava, told Die Tagespost that Veritatis Splendor is not only still valid, but shows timeless truths.\nPromulgated 25 years ago, the encyclical rejects authoritatively the theory of situation ethics, a theory that seems to be getting again much attention in our time, for example by theologians such as Professor Maurizio Chiodi.\nProfessor Livio Melina, the former President of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and the Family, was another speaker at the February 6 conference.\nHe stressed that Amoris Laetitia has to be “read in the context of the magisterial instructions of the encyclical Veritatis Splendor, which recalls the connection between conscience and truth, as well as the necessity of a well-formed conscience.” In returning to that encyclical, explained the Italian professor and theologian, Amoris Laetitia could be given a hermeneutic in light of a “continuity with the Magisterium of the Church.” He also said: “The Commandments are an expression of the Love of God for us.\nIf we fulfill them, we are united with God.”\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_Authority|834|846\nLoaded_Language|45|67\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|983|1127\nLoaded_Language|1029|1063\nLoaded_Language|1338|1505\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|2177|2229\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|2240|2345\nAppeal_to_Authority|2479|2572\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|2682|2753\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|4118|4224\nName_Calling,Labeling|1302|1322\nName_Calling,Labeling|1445|1467."}

{"prompt":"Dallas Police Dept.\nfires officer who killed Botham Jean in his apartment\n\nThe Dallas Police Department fired Officer Amber Guyger on Monday, two weeks after she was charged in the fatal shooting of her neighbor.\nThis contradicted the police chief’s recent statements that she was unable to discipline the officer while a criminal investigation proceeded.\n\nGuyger allegedly walked into the apartment of the neighbor, Botham Jean, and fatally shot him Sept 6.\n\nWhen she was arrested three days later on manslaughter charges, Guyger said she confused Jean’s home for her own, confused Jean for an intruder, and shot him when he refused her commands, according to court documents.\nThe victim’s family has disputed her account and said she had knocked on Jean’s door before killing him.\n\nThe incident — one of more than 700 police killings counted by The Washington Post this year — sparked criticism against the police department, which waited days to arrest Guyger, then went weeks without disciplining her even though she was placed on leave.\n“The delay raised questions about why investigators held off on arresting the officer and about whether law enforcement authorities were showing deferential treatment for one of their own,” Kristine Phillips and Deanna Paul wrote for The Post.\n\nAfter repeated protests, Police Chief U. Reneé Hall gave contradictory explanations last week for why she could not fire the officer.\nShe told a town hall that “local, state and federal laws prohibit me from taking action,” according to ABC affiliate WFAA.\n\nTwo days later, the Dallas Morning News reported that police could fire Guyger but did not plan to review her employment until a criminal investigation wrapped up — probably months away.\nIn a statement, Hall said that any disciplinary investigation would risk compromising the criminal case.\n“That is not a risk I am willing to take,” she said.\n\nPolice did not explain what changed by Monday, when the department announced that an internal-affairs investigation had been launched and already “concluded” that Guyger’s arrest was a fireable offense.\nThe officer, who was hired in late 2013, was terminated during a hearing Monday morning “for her actions.”\n\nThe statement notes that Guyger can appeal her firing.\nPolice did not comment on whether Hall is still worried that the termination might affect the criminal investigation.\n\nAs Paul wrote for The Post, the more significant legal questions are whether Guyger is prosecuted as a police officer or civilian and whether a jury decides she acted reasonably in using deadly force.\n>","completion":" no propaganda found."}

At this time, I will be focusing on the issues of this important election.\"\n\nEllison’s ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, alleged in August that Ellison dragged her off a bed by her feet while screaming obscenities at her in 2016.\nMonahan said she had video footage of the incident and levied the allegation just days ahead of a crowded Democratic primary for Minnesota attorney general that Ellison went on to win.\n\nThe state's Democratic party launched an investigation into the claim, retaining a local attorney with links to the state party to determine whether the alleged incident took place.\nDemocratic party chairman Ken Martin said last week he expected the investigation to conclude soon.\n\nA draft report obtained by the AP noted Monahan's shifting rationale for refusing to produce the video footage, including that it was lost, was on a USB drive in storage and would be too embarrassing and traumatic to release it.\n\nThe Ellison accusations have put Democrats in an uncomfortable position, as they speak out on sexual misconduct claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\nKavanaugh denies the accusations.\n\nMonahan slammed the Democratic Party for its response to her allegations when compared to its treatment of Christine Blasey Ford.\nFord has accused Kavanaugh of attempting to force himself onto her during a high school party nearly four decades ago.\nMany prominent Democrats have supported Ford’s allegations.\n\n“No, they don't,” Monahan tweeted in response to a question of whether the party believes women’s stories.\n“I've been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party.\nI provided medical records from 2017, stating on two different Dr.\nVisits, I told them about the abuse and who did it.\nMy therapist released records stating I have been dealing and healing from the abuse.”\n\nShe added: “Four people, including my supervisor at the time, stated that I came to them after and shared the exact story I shared publicly, I shared multiple text between me and Keith, where I discuss the abuse with him and much more.\nAs I said before, I knew I wouldn't be believed.”\nMany other Democrats and progressives – who largely stayed silent after the accusations against Ellison emerged – came out in support of Ford, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, who urged to investigate the claims and Kavanaugh.\n\nMonahan went to reiterate that her story has nothing to do with politics.\n“I have nothing to prove to anyone, I simply shared my story.\nPeople can believe it or not.\nI don’t need anyone to affirm my humanity, I affirmed it,” she wrote in another tweet.\n\n“The fact that both parties only care if it scores political points is hypocritical,” she added.\n“Do you think a person who has dealt with any form of abuse by politicians is thinking about politics?\nNo, we & are families are trying to heal.”\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|4321|4333."}

{"prompt":"Hundreds of Priests Accused in Pennsylvania, Church of Accompaniment in Crisis\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday released a sweeping grand jury report on sex abuse in the Catholic Church, listing hundreds of accused clergy and detailing 70 years of misconduct and church response across the state.\n\nThe release is the culmination of an 18-month probe, led by state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, on six of the state’s eight dioceses — Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Allentown, Scranton, Erie and Greensburg — and follows other state grand jury reports that revealed abuse and coverups in two other dioceses.\n\nSome details and names that might reveal the 300 clergy listed have been redacted from the report.\nLegal challenges by clergy delayed the report’s release, after some said it is a violation of their constitutional rights.\nPennsylvania’s Supreme Court ruled last month that the report must be released but with some redaction.\n\nThe report’s release begins an information war, with prosecutors and many victims saying it’s the start of holding church leaders at the top accountable for the first time, while church lawyers and other advocates for the institution say the report depicts an era of another century, unfairly smearing today’s Catholicism in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe report has helped renew a crisis many in the church thought and hoped had ended nearly 20 years ago after the scandal erupted in Boston.\nBut recent abuse-related scandals, from Chile to Australia, have reopened wounding questions about accountability and whether church officials are still covering up crimes at the highest levels.\n\nThe new wave of allegations has called Pope Francis’s handling of abuse into question as many Catholics look to him to help the church regain its credibility.\nThe pope’s track record has been mixed, something some outsiders attribute to his learning curve or shortcomings and others chalk up to resistance from a notoriously change-averse institution.\n\nThe Pennsylvania grand jury report follows the resignation last month of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, a towering figure in the U.S. church and former D.C. archbishop who was accused of sexually abusing minors and adults for decades.\nBoth have further polarized the church on homosexuality, celibacy and whether laypeople should have more power.\nIt has also triggered debate about whether statutes of limitations should be expanded.\n\n“We’re dealing with a long-term struggle not only about the meaning of justice, but about the meaning of memory,” said Jason Berry, a reporter and author who has covered the sexual abuse crisis for decades.\n“And how honest the church has been about this crisis.\nMost bishops, besides apologies, have not been on the cutting edge of change.”\n\nChurch officials began bracing for the aftermath of the report.\nOn Monday, D.C.’s archbishop, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, former longtime leader of the Pittsburgh diocese, warned his priests in a letter that the probe will be “profoundly disturbing.”\nREMNANT COMMENT: The report also shows that “more than 90 ‘offenders’ will be listed” in Donald Cardinal Wuerl’s former diocese, which is ironic since Wuerl is one of Pope Francis’s closest U.S. advisers and sits on the Vatican’s bishop oversight committee.\nWell played, Cardinal Wuerl!\nSo, let me get this straight (I know, lots of luck with that one): These are the people that are going to \"accompany us\" and our children in the \"synodal Church\" with its new orientation, overseen by a \"God of Surprises\" who is uber-merciful and doesn't judge, and headed up by a pope who, according to Father Thomas Rosica, \"breaks Catholic traditions whenever he wants, because he is 'free from disordered attachments'?''\nYou don't say!\nAll this and rampant homosexuality in the priesthood, too... along with a \"trivialized liturgy\" (according to Pope Benedict XVI) and widespread apostasy among the faithful?\nRemind me again: What exactly has Vatican II and the last fifty years of aggiornamento given us?\nBecause I can't seem to think of a darn thing, apart from heretical homilies, sodomitical clergy and an increasingly lavender liturgy.\nYou know what, guys?\nThanks, but no thanks.\nYou can take your 'Church of Accompaniment\" to prison with you.\nI'd sooner let my kids be accompanied by fans of the Oakland Raiders than turn them over to you... meaning no disrespect to fans of the Oakland Raiders, of course.\n#stopthesynod\n>","completion":"

counsel to the Supervisor of Elections Office.\nEvelyn Perez-Verdia, a former office spokeswoman who left several years ago, said Sunday evening she was told by people in the office that the letter was sent “to Tallahassee” earlier in the day.\nNorris-Weeks said she saw an early draft of the letter.\nIn the version she saw, she said Snipes, 75, expressed a desire to spend more time with her family.\nIn the final version of the resignation letter, sent to Gov.\nRick Scott, Snipes said it was her “passion and honor” to have served in the office.\n“I am ready to pass the torch,” she wrote in the letter, which made no mention of controversies surrounding the 2018 election.\nBy the way, she missed her deadline.\n“Although I have enjoyed this work tremendously over these many election cycles, both large and small, I am ready to pass the torch,” she wrote.\nShe should be ready for prison bars after the fiasco she has created.\nSnipes allowed illegal aliens, non-citizens and felons to vote.\nAccording to Breitbart, she illegally destroyed ballots.\nThree statewide races in Florida are headed to a recount and all depend on results from a county whose supervisor of elections has a history of losing ballots and breaking laws by allowing illegal immigrants and felons to vote, as well as illegally destroying ballots.\nBroward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes’ office has admitted “they don’t know” how many ballots there are still to count.\nSnipes’ latest failure to finalize Tuesday’s election returns days after the polls closed is also in violation of Florida law, which requires elections officials to “report all early voting and all tabulated vote-by-mail results to the Department of State within 30 minutes after the polls close.\nThereafter, the canvassing board shall report, with the exception of provisional ballot results, updated precinct election results to the department at least every 45 minutes until all results are completely reported.”\nThe irony that a constitutionally ineligible candidate for the presidency and RINO extraordinaire, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), pointed out that voter fraud going on in Florida just a day after the elections probably didn't help the pressure that Snipes was facing.\nNo evidence of fraud in #FloridaElection?\nDems got voters to use altered forms to fix & submit as many mail ballots as possible after FL deadline in hopes that a judge would later order state to count them.\nToday that’s exactly what a federal judge did.\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/MC4Tlvy9gi — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) November 15, 2018\nNaples Daily News:\nA day after Florida’s election left top state races too close to call, a Democratic party leader directed staffers and volunteers to share altered election forms with voters to fix signature problems on absentee ballots after the state’s deadline.\nThe altered forms surfaced in Broward, Santa Rosa, Citrus and Okaloosa counties and were reported to federal prosecutors to review for possible election fraud as Florida counties completed a required recount in three top races.\nBut an email obtained by the USA TODAY NETWORK – Florida shows that Florida Democrats were organizing a broader statewide effort beyond those counties to give voters the altered forms to fix improper absentee ballots after the Nov. 5 deadline.\nDemocratic party leaders provided staffers with copies of a form, known as a “cure affidavit,” that had been modified to include an inaccurate Nov. 8 deadline.\nWe also know that a Broward County employee, Chelsey Smith, signed an affidavit affirming that she had seen members of Snipes' staff engaging in voter fraud.\nShe ignored a court order, mixed invalid provisional ballots in with valid ones, and destroyed ballots, but don't worry, a Democrat attorney says that doing so has nothing to do with fraud or corruption.\nNow that federal prosecutors have gotten involved, perhaps it's time to quit talking about it and actually arrest this woman and charge her with crimes against the people of Broward County before more people end up dead in Broward County over their corrupt voting practices.\nArticle posted

{"prompt":"Assange Never Met Manafort.\nLuke Harding and the Guardian Publish Still More Blatant MI6 Lies\n\nThe right wing Ecuadorean government of President Moreno continues to churn out its production line of fake documents regarding Julian Assange, and channel them straight to MI6 mouthpiece Luke Harding of the Guardian.\nAmazingly, more Ecuadorean Government documents have just been discovered for the Guardian, this time spy agency reports detailing visits of Paul Manafort and unspecified “Russians” to the Embassy.\nBy a wonderful coincidence of timing, this is the day after Mueller announced that Manafort’s plea deal was over.\nThe problem with this latest fabrication is that Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry.\nNeither Manafort nor these “Russians” are in the visitor logs.\nThis is impossible.\nThe visitor logs were not kept by Wikileaks, but by the very strict Ecuadorean security.\nNobody was ever admitted without being entered in the logs.\nThe procedure was very thorough.\nTo go in, you had to submit your passport (no other type of document was accepted).\nA copy of your passport was taken and the passport details entered into the log.\nYour passport, along with your mobile phone and any other electronic equipment, was retained until you left, along with your bag and coat.\nI feature in the logs every time I visited.\nThere were no exceptions.\nFor an exception to be made for Manafort and the “Russians” would have had to be a decision of the Government of Ecuador, not of Wikileaks, and that would be so exceptional the reason for it would surely have been noted in the now leaked supposed Ecuadorean “intelligence report” of the visits.\nWhat possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort?\nFurthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency – who were in charge of the security – would not know the identity of these alleged “Russians”.\nPreviously Harding and the Guardian have published documents faked by the Moreno government regarding a diplomatic appointment to Russia for Assange of which he had no knowledge.\nNow they follow this up with more documents aimed to provide fictitious evidence to bolster Mueller’s pathetically failed attempt to substantiate the story that Russia deprived Hillary of the Presidency.\nMy friend William Binney, probably the world’s greatest expert on electronic surveillance, former Technical Director of the NSA, has stated that it is impossible the DNC servers were hacked, the technical evidence shows it was a download to a directly connected memory stick.\nI knew the US security services were conducting a fake investigation the moment it became clear that the FBI did not even themselves look at the DNC servers, instead accepting a report from the Clinton linked DNC “security consultants” Crowdstrike.\nI would love to believe that the fact Julian has never met Manafort is bound to be established.\nBut I fear that state control of propaganda may be such that this massive “Big Lie” will come to enter public consciousness in the same way as the non-existent Russian hack of the DNC servers.\nAssange never met Manafort.\nThe DNC emails were downloaded by an insider.\nAssange never even considered fleeing to Russia.\nThose are the facts, and I am in a position to give you a personal assurance of them.\nI can also assure you that Luke Harding, the Guardian, Washington Post and New York Times have been publishing a stream of deliberate lies, in collusion with the security services.\nI am not a fan of Donald Trump.\nBut to see the partisans of the defeated candidate (and a particularly obnoxious defeated candidate) manipulate the security services and the media to create an entirely false public perception, in order to attempt to overturn the result of the US Presidential election, is the most astonishing thing I have witnessed in my lifetime.\nPlainly the government of Ecuador is releasing lies about Assange to curry favour with the security establishment of the USA and UK, and to damage Assange’s support prior to expelling him from the Embassy.\nHe will then be extradited from London to the USA on charges of espionage.\nAssange is not a whistleblower or a spy – he is the greatest publisher of his age, and has done more to bring the crimes of governments to light than the mainstream media will ever be motivated to achieve.\nThat supposedly great newspaper titles like the Guardian, New York Times and Washington Post are involved in the spreading of lies to damage Assange, and are seeking his imprisonment for publishing state secrets, is clear evidence that the idea of the “liberal media” no longer exists in the new plutocratic age.\nThe press are not on the side of the people, they are an instrument of elite control.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”\n\nIt should be clear by now that the entire official narrative surrounding the Las Vegas shooting that left 59 people dead and hundreds injured is falling apart.\nFrom shooter Paddock’s check-in date and the existence of a second person in his room, to possible connections to a terrorist organization, as well as the the actual timeline of events, everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny.\nIn the last 24 hours the Sheriff’s Department has significantly revised the event timeline and a key incident involving the shooting of a Mandalay Bay security guard.\nOriginally, as highlighted by The Daily Sheeple, the security guard was hailed as being responsible for preventing the shooter from continuing his massacre because he interrupted him in the middle of the attack.\nAs it turns out, security guard Jesus Campos was actually shot BEFORE Paddock opened fire on the concert crowd below his 32nd floor hotel suite.\nAs part of the constantly changing story, officials are now saying that police officers who rushed to the hotel room when the shooting began didn’t know a hotel security guard had been shot “until they met him in the hallway after exiting the elevator,” Lombardo said.\nThe security guard, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman, from behind his door, shot into the hallway on the 32nd floor.\nPaddock apparently detected Campos via surveillance cameras he set up outside his hotel suite, police have said.\nPaddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time, Lombardo said, shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes.\nPolice officers found Campos when they arrived on the floor.\nAnd Campos did not summon police to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, according to the timeline recently updated by the authorities.\nWhat’s also incredibly interesting, is that eyewitnesses claim to have seen security guards chasing another security guard in the minutes leading up to the massacre.\nThe hotel guest in the room next to Paddock also saw “multiple gunmen.” The Full Report: The Ever-Changing Vegas Narrative: Gunman Shot Security Guard Before Massacre\nAs of today, here is the revised timeline, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times:\nThe new timeline has left investigators and researchers with new questions, two of which are extremely important:\nWhat happened during the 6 minutes between Campos being shot and Paddock opening fire, and why weren’t the police rushing to the scene immediately?\nWhy did shooter Stephen Paddock stop shooting?\nPaddock had already shot the security guard, waited six minutes before opening fire on the concert crowd, and then shot for a full ten minutes.\nPolice didn’t arrive for two additional minutes after the shooting stopped – which is a full 18 minutes from the moment Campos was initially hit.\nMoreover, did he stop shooting because he was planning his escape from the 32nd floor?\nOr is it possible that Paddock was rushed and in a state of panic?\nAccording to links and information shared by Thomas Wictor and a timeline assessment by Twitter user Mr. Alex, the plausibility of Paddock accidentally killing himself amid the confusion, adrenaline and panic is quite high:\nLatest LV Sheriff: Saying they still don’t know why he stopped shooting.\n@drawandstrike theory looking plausiblehttps:\/\/t.co\/CQF3MZLHaN — Mr Alex ???\n(@New_England_) October 10, 2017\nWhile we may never know the exact circumstances surrounding what transpired in the shooter’s hotel room, the information being released not just by law enforcement, but witnesses to the event who recorded hundreds of cumulative hours of video and audio, now calls the entirety official story into question.\n>","completion":" Doubt|2630|2685\nDoubt|1115|1140\nDoubt|3585|3632."}

{"prompt":"CNN’s Jim Acosta Has Press Pass Restored by White House\n\nJim Acosta has his press pass back.\n\nThe Trump administration stood down on Monday from its nearly two-week-long dispute with CNN over the White House credentials of Mr. Acosta, informing the correspondent that his badge was formally restored.\nCNN in turn dropped its lawsuit on the matter, which had ballooned into a test of press freedoms in the Trump era.\n\nBut while it yielded to Mr. Acosta — whose testy questions had touched off Mr. Trump’s ire — the administration used the occasion to lay down a set of formal rules governing reporters’ behavior at future White House news conferences, a highly unusual step.\n\nAmong the guidelines was a restriction of one question per reporter, with follow-ups allowed at the discretion of the president or the White House official at the lectern.\n“Failure to abide,” the administration warned, “may result in suspension or revocation of the journalist’s hard pass.”\n\nThe White House sought to blame Mr. Acosta for behaving disrespectfully, although Mr. Trump often lobs insults at journalists and encourages a free-for-all format when taking questions from reporters.\nCodifying the behavior of journalists struck some as an ominous encroachment into freedom of the press, and the White House Correspondents’ Association said on Monday that it had not been consulted about the new guidelines.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, in a statement, said: “These rules give the White House far too much discretion to avoid real scrutiny.\nThe White House belongs to the public, not the president, and the job of the press is to ask hard questions, not to be polite company.”\nStill, the guidelines are not far removed from the manner in which White House news conferences typically proceed.\nMr. Trump made clear last week that he would introduce “regulations” after a federal judge criticized the White House for stripping Mr. Acosta’s credentials without due process or a coherent rationale.\n\n“We would have greatly preferred to continue hosting White House press conferences in reliance on a set of understood professional norms, and we believe the overwhelming majority of journalists covering the White House share that preference,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, said in a statement.\n\nPress relations were not always rosy in pre-Trump days.\nPresident Barack Obama’s aides preselected the news outlets that were allowed to ask questions at his news conferences.\nMr. Obama often chastised reporters, including Mr. Acosta on one occasion, for questions he deemed overly aggressive or grandstanding.\nBut Mr. Trump, a devoted news consumer who relishes his coverage, plays up his conflicts with reporters in part to excite his supporters.\nHe has held far fewer formal news conferences than his predecessors, and the daily White House briefing has virtually disappeared on his watch.\n\nRevoking Mr. Acosta’s White House badge was the most severe step yet, and it soon became apparent that the move would not pass legal muster: After suing last week, Mr. Acosta was granted the temporary return of his credentials by a federal judge.\n\nA back-and-forth ensued over the weekend.\nBill Shine, the deputy chief of staff for communications, sent a letter to Mr. Acosta that listed several reasons that his pass had been revoked, perhaps an attempt to satisfy the judge’s request for a clear rationale.\nCNN’s lawyers called the note an “after-the-fact concocted process.” By Monday afternoon, the sides had reached a resolution.\n\nAides to Mr. Trump say that the president does not mind answering questions, pointing to his numerous impromptu sessions with reporters during White House photo-ops and Marine One departures.\nThe aides complain about reporters who they say do not respect the solemnity of the setting, even as Mr. Trump flouts many of the norms associated with his office.\n\n“The White House’s interaction is, and generally should be, subject to a natural give-and-take,” Ms. Sanders wrote on Monday, suggesting that the onus was on the press corps to ensure that a “code of conduct” did not become necessary.\n\nThat notion read more like a warning — behave or else — and the Correspondents’ Association seemed unmoved.\n\n“For as long as there have been White House press conferences, White House reporters have asked follow-up questions,” the group wrote on Monday.\n“We fully expect this tradition will continue.”\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|1224|1244\nLoaded_Language|2593|2606\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|4159|4173\nLoaded_Language|358|367\nLoaded_Language|460|465\nLoaded_Language|504|507\nLoaded_Language|1070|1077\nLoaded_Language|2572|2589\nName_Calling,Labeling|2625|2646\nLoaded_Language|2944|2950\nLoaded_Language|3830|3836."}

Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 soldiers in 2009 while serving at Fort Hood.\nIn the process, however, he misidentified Hasan as Nidal Hussein and said the shooting happened at Fort Knox in Kentucky.\nHe also said Hasan had died a martyr, though in fact he remains alive on military death row.\nCourt documents show Patel began saying in late 2016 that he did not actually support the Islamic State.\nSimply expressing support for a terrorist organization or attack is not against the law.\nPatel's crime was failing to disclose his trips to Jordan when he was trying to join the Army and Air Force in December 2016 and January 2017.\nCourt documents say Patel lied about his travel history, saying his only time out of the country in the past seven years was a family trip to India in 2011 and 2012.\nBefore Patel signed the Army application, a recruiter asked him specifically about the travel question and reminded him providing false information could result in criminal charges.\nDuring the interview, the recruiter asked to see Patel's passport to confirm his travel claims.\nPatel agreed to bring it by, but two days later he told the State Department he had accidentally thrown it away in October and needed a new one.\nAfter Patel's arrest in July, investigators found his passport \"near\" the motel room where he was living, the documents said.\n©2018 The Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Va.)\nVisit The Virginian-Pilot at pilotonline.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_fear-prejudice|1976|2018\nDoubt|380|567\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1749|1847\nName_Calling,Labeling|2823|2831\nDoubt|2673|2886\nFlag-Waving|2020|2177\nDoubt|3669|3812."}

{"prompt":"Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith\n\nNewsCatholic Church, Family, Marriage\nROME, February 2, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) —His Excellency Marian Eleganti, auxiliary bishop of Chur in Switzerland, today added his name to the “Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage,” bringing the total number of signatories to eight bishops and one cardinal, LifeSite has confirmed.\nBishop Eleganti’s support of the profession comes just three days after Bishop Athanasius Schneider, auxiliary of Astana, Kazakstan, invited the world’s bishops to sign the document and join in raising a common voice in defense of the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage.\n“God decides the time, and the time will come when the Pope and the episcopacy again will proclaim, with all clarity, unambiguity and beauty, the sanctity of marriage, and of the family, and of the Eucharist,” Schneider told LifesiteNews in an exclusive Jan. 15 interview.\nRaising a Common Voice\nIn conversation with LifeSiteNews, Schneider said greater public support of the document from the world’s 5,000 bishops would be “a stronger voice for professing the constant truths of the Church, and it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.”\nThe Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage was issued by three Kazakh Ordinaries, including Bishop Schneider, in early January.\nIn the document, the three bishops solemnly professed the Church’s received teaching and discipline regarding sacramental marriage and the limited conditions (see Familiaris Consortio, n. 84) under which Catholics who are divorced and “remarried” may receive sacramental absolution and Holy Communion.\nThey presented their profession “before God who will judge us,” in response to certain pastoral norms issued by several bishops’ conferences aimed at implementing chapter 8 of Pope Francis’ apostolic exhortation on the family, Amoris Laetitia.\nSome of these norms, Schneider told LifeSiteNews, give “implicit approval” of divorce and of sexual activity outside a valid marriage.\nSuch a reading is causing “rampant confusion,” will spread “a plague of divorce” in the Church, and is “alien” to the Church’s entire faith and Tradition, the three bishops said in the profession.\n“This is contrary to Divine Revelation,” Schneider further told LifeSite, adding that the “beautiful explanations” that are being presented to clergy and faithful as “discernment” and “pastoral accompaniment,” or a “change of paradigm” and “discovery of the subjective part of the truth,” when translated into “common sense language,” are tantamount to an allowance to sin.\n“Our conscience as bishops calls to us to do this,” Schneider explained.\n“We were forced by our conscience, in the conscience of the Successors of the Apostles and colleagues of the Pope.”\nAs Successors of the Apostles, Schneider said they “could not act in another way.”\nBishop Marian Eleganti\nThe profession’s most recent signatory, Bishop Marian Eleganti, O.S.B., is a monk of the abbey of the Missionary Benedictines in St. Otmarsberg in Uznach, located in the canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland.\nHe was ordained to the priesthood on June 23, 1995.\nIn July 1999, the monks of St. Otmarsberg Abbey (the youngest abbey in Switzerland) elected Eleganti the second abbot of the monastery.\nThe Missionary Benedictines in Uznach belong to the Benedictine Congregation of St. Ottilien near Munich, with branches in Europe, East, West and South Africa, South America, Cuba and the USA, India, Korea, China, Kazakhstan and the Philippines.\nIn 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Abbot Marian Eleganti as auxiliary bishop of the diocese of Chur, Switzerland.\nHe was ordained a bishop on Jan. 31, 2010.\nSince 2011, Bishop Eleganti has served as the Swiss Youth Bishop for German-speaking Switzerland on behalf of the Swiss Bishops’ Conference, and as vicar for religious and monastic communities.\nHe is also the vicar for the philosophical-theological education and ongoing formation and training of pastoral workers.\nBishop Marian Eleganti’s public support of the Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage brings the number of signatories to nine.\nTo date, in addition to the three original signatories from Kazakstan, the following prelates have signed the profession: Cardinal Janis Pujats, Emeritus Archbishop Metropolitan of Riga, Latvia; Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, former apostolic nuncio to the United States; His Excellency Luigi Negri, Archbishop emeritus of Ferrara-Comacchio, Italy; Bishop Andreas Laun, Emeritus Auxiliary of Salzburg, Austria;

{"prompt":"MAJOR NEW STUDY: Homeschooling Spikes Due to School Violence, Far-Left Bias\n\nAccording to a 33-year-long study conducted by the National Home Education Research Institute in Oregon, the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment.\nAs reported by The Washington Times, the recent school shooting at Parkland, Fla., was the last straw for scores of parents.\nThe paper noted that “the phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven’t stopped yet.”\nThe Times added:The Lubbock-based organization has been swamped with inquiries for months from parents seeking safer options for their kids in the aftermath of this year’s deadly school massacres, first in Parkland and then in Santa Fe, Texas.\n“When the Parkland shooting happened, our phone calls and emails exploded,” said coalition president Tim Lambert.\n“In the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled.\nWe’re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month, and prior to that it was 600 to 700.”\nWhile the debate rages anew over familiar topics following such tragedies — tougher, more restrictive gun control laws and bolstering security at public schools — the revolution in homeschooling has been taking place quietly, behind the scenes and off the radar screens of most political organizations.\nBut again, it’s not just the shootings, which admittedly have increased in the past couple of years.\nChristopher Chin, head of Homeschool Louisiana, told The Times that parents are fed up with “the violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments.”\nThe Left is driving more kids OUT of public schools\nThere is also the Left-wing social engineering.\nThe craziness over transgender students and bathrooms\/locker rooms, allowing students to “take a knee” during the playing of the National Anthem, the Left-wing curriculum, and refusing to allow students to wear shirts that praise POTUS Trump or feature the American flag are also driving parents into homeschooling.\nREMNANT COMMENT: We here at The Remnant are always eager to promote the home-schooling movement, and this report helps illustrate why.\nAt the moment and personally speaking, my own family’s home-school is going great guns.\nWe have a daughter still in high school and three in grade school.\nOur family couldn't be happier with our decision to homeschool---yes, all the way through high school.\nAnd as for our older home-schooled children: My third-eldest child is preparing to head off to college in the fall.\nHer older sister just finished a semester studying in Austria and will graduate with a double major and a minor degree next spring.\nMy son will be a junior this fall, working on a Mass Communications degree at Franciscan University.\nHere's an example of his work:\nPerhaps this video from a couple of years ago will be useful to those considering home-schooling this fall:\nFriends, please give serious thought and prayer to home-schooling your children.\nI realize it’s a challenge, but few challenges have greater payoffs in this world or the next.\nThere is no better way to keep the Catholic family together and committed to the Catholic restoration than the Catholic home school.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|843|866\nLoaded_Language|45|60\nLoaded_Language|1705|1713\nLoaded_Language|1719|1727\nLoaded_Language|1859|1868\nLoaded_Language|727|734\nLoaded_Language|1371|1381\nRepetition|478|493\nRepetition|934|942\nRepetition|1536|1545\nRepetition|3309|3317\nRepetition|3339|3347\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|3228|3359\nName_Calling,Labeling|1825|1853\nSlogans|3254|3287\nExaggeration,Minimisation|980|988\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2472|2491."}

Trump for the area, declaring him a “bigot”.\nThe council has been at the centre of serious corruption scandals, including the removal of an Islamist mayor who was found guilty of bribing Muslim groups and wielding “undue spiritual influence” on Muslim voters.\nThe anti-Trump motion, proposed by Councillor Ohid Ahmed and Councillor Oliur Rahman, passed by a majority vote this week.\nIt calls for President Trump’s planned state visit to the United Kingdom to be cancelled, adding: “Should the Government still choose to go ahead with State Visit, this Council makes clear that President Trump would not be welcome in our Borough.” The area in East London includes the famous Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf, but the ban does not appear to be enforceable.\nThe current Labour mayor, John Biggs, complained that President Trump “doesn’t applaud diversity [and] doesn’t respect the culture of others and doesn’t respect women”.\nThe mayor added: “He is failing in his leadership and we should not welcome him here.\nWe must be vigorous in our intolerance of his intolerance.” In response to the news, Peter Golds, the leader of the Conservatives group in the council, tweeted: “In 2015 one of the Tower Hamlets First election candidates tweeted ‘let us support Hitler the Great.’ These people, corruptly elected, have no shame.\nFor the record, our group refused to vote in this farce.” “Tower Hamlets is home to one of the country’s most diverse communities,” the motion begins, adding that it “has the highest percentage of Muslim residents in England – 35 per cent compared with the national average of 5 per cent”.\nAfter several paragraphs of platitudes about “community cohesion” and “diversity”, it says “this Council notes with shock and alarm the decision by Donald Trump, President of the United States, to ‘retweet’ Islamophobic propaganda from the Britain First Twitter account”.\nIt also bemoans that he has allegedly “bigoted attitude towards women, ethnic minorities and Muslims which has resulted in examples of division and hatred within the USA and beyond” and attacks his “illogical” decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\nThe motion also notes that the neighbouring Royal Borough of Greenwich formally adopted a similar motion in December last year….\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|3015|3031\nExaggeration,Minimisation|118|137\nLoaded_Language|189|228\nExaggeration,Minimisation|459|515\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|918|1208\nName_Calling,Labeling|1223|1265\nLoaded_Language|2585|2611\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|2770|2829\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3015|3033\nLoaded_Language|3048|3065\nLoaded_Language|3579|3602\nLoaded_Language|3665|3744\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|3912|4039\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|517|629\nLoaded_Language|319|349\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|918|1206\nLoaded_Language|1223|1254\nName_Calling,Labeling|1799|1804\nAppeal_to_Authority|2702|2827\nLoaded_Language|3488|3503."}

{"prompt":"“It’s gotta be a set-up”: Neighbor of Las Vegas Shooter Claims He Didn’t Do It\n\nThis report was originally published by Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars.com\nA caller to the Michael Savage radio show who says he was neighbors with Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock asserts that Paddock could not have carried out the massacre and that it was actually a “set-up”.\nThe man, a former Marine who called himself Rick, says he was Paddock’s neighbor between December 2015 and June 2016 in Mesquite, Nevada.\n“I can tell you 100% this is not that kind of guy,” said Rick, adding that he would see Paddock every other day and that the two would go to a local bar and play slot machines.\n“He never even told me that he owned a gun,” continued the shooter’s neighbor, adding that Paddock did not express any religious or political opinions during their conversations.\n“I’m not a big conspiracy theory guy, but it don’t sit right,” said Rick, before making the extraordinary claim that the whole shooting was a “set up” and that Paddock’s body may have been left in the hotel room while other assailants carried out the shooting.\nThe caller mentioned how some people in the crowd were warned 45 minutes before the shooting that they were going to die, suggesting that this was evidence of a wider plot and not a “lone wolf” attack.\nAs a firearms expert, he also questioned the lack of flashes coming from the hotel windows where the shooter was supposedly firing from.\nRick said he had already contacted the Clark County Sheriff’s Office to relay all the information he knew.\nAlthough the claims are intriguing, it is important to remember that after virtually every terror attack and mass shooting, friends and neighbors express shock that the culprit would be capable of carrying out such horrors, with some outright denying it to be possible.\nIf Paddock was planning such a sophisticated operation and hoping to evade detection, he would not be blabbing details about it to his neighbors.\nHowever, the neighbor’s claims are certain to attract more attention given that no specific motive has yet to be uncovered for the shooting.\nWhat do you think?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nSUBSCRIBE on YouTube:\nFollow on Twitter: Follow @PrisonPlanet\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PaulJosephWatson\/\n*********************\nPaul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com.\n>","completion":" Black-and-White_Fallacy|274|321\nThought-terminating_Cliches|854|913\nDoubt|1013|1112\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|1629|1719\nAppeal_to_Authority|498|546\nDoubt|1|23."}
{"prompt":"In first public rebuke by the White House, Mnuchin pulls out of Saudi investment conference to protest Khashoggi case\n\nWASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Thursday he was pulling out of a major Saudi investment conference, known as Davos in the Desert, in the first public rebuke by the White House of the Saudi regime over the disappearance and suspected murder of a dissident Saudi journalist who lived in Virginia.\nTrade and finance ministers from Britain, France, Holland and other countries, the head of the International Monetary Fund, as well as CEOs of multiple major companies already had withdrawn in protest, and Mnuchin was under growing pressure to add his name to the list.\nMnuchin tweeted the decision after meeting with President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo at the White House.\nPompeo later told reporters that he had urged the president to give the Saudi government “a few more days” to explain what happened to Jamal Khashoggi, who vanished after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on Oct. 2.\nTurkish authorities and media have said audio recordings show that Khashoggi was tortured and beheaded inside the consulate, although the recordings have not been released.\nKhashoggi wrote opinion columns for the Washington Post critical of the Saudi royal family.\nSaudi King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler, have denied to both Trump and Pompeo any knowledge of the alleged murder or having ordered it.\nPompeo returned Wednesday night from meetings with Saudi and Turkish leaders in Riyadh and Ankara and went to the White House Thursday morning to brief Trump, who has come under mounting pressure from Congress and rights groups to punish Saudi Arabia.\nPompeo said the Saudis “understand the serious nature” of Khashoggi’s disappearance, and would conduct a thorough and “timely” investigation.\nTheir findings, Pompeo said, “will be transparent for everyone to see, to ask questions about, to inquire with respect to its thoroughness.”\nHe said he told the president “that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we too have a complete understanding of the facts” before making decisions on how the U.S. should respond.\nTurkey is conducting its own probe, and Pompeo said those results will also be taken into consideration.\nHe again stressed the importance of Saudi Arabia as a strategic ally, in a relationship, he noted, that dates back more than 80 years.\nThe administration’s reluctance to condemn the Saudi government has fueled criticism from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, from diplomats and from even some corporations that long have profited from close relations with the Saudi royal family.\n“We just are going to allow the process to move forward, allow the facts to unfold,” Pompeo said.\n“And as they unfold, as we make a determination for ourselves about what happened there, based on the facts that are presented to us, the United States will determine what the appropriate response might be.”\n— Tracy Wilkinson\nLos Angeles Times\n———\n©2018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_fear-prejudice|1154|1175\nFlag-Waving|2991|3008."}
{"prompt":"Gun Control Is Now Truly Impossible\n\nGun control is the dream of every wannabe statist dictator and naive do-gooder alike.\nThe latter think that removing guns will suddenly force humanity to stop all animosity toward one another, hold hands, and sing Kumbaya.\nThe former recognizes that an armed populace is a threat to any tyrant and pushes for gun control out of self-preservation.\nHowever, a new ruling in a court case over 3-D printer files of guns has now made gun control virtually impossible.\nFIVE YEARS AGO, 25-year-old radical libertarian Cody Wilson stood on a remote central Texas gun range and pulled the trigger on the world’s first fully 3-D-printed gun.\nWhen, to his relief, his plastic invention fired a .380-caliber bullet into a berm of dirt without jamming or exploding in his hands, he drove back to Austin and uploaded the blueprints for the pistol to his website, Defcad.com.\nDefend Yourself: A Com...\nRob Pincus Best Price: $2.00 Buy New $17.99 (as of 03:35 EDT - Details) He’d launched the site months earlier along with an anarchist video manifesto, declaring that gun control would never be the same in an era when anyone can download and print their own firearm with a few clicks.\nIn the days after that first test-firing, his gun was downloaded more than 100,000 times.\nWilson made the decision to go all in on the project, dropping out of law school at the University of Texas, as if to confirm his belief that technology supersedes law.\nThe law caught up.\nLess than a week later, Wilson received a letter from the US State Department demanding that he take down his printable-gun blueprints or face prosecution for violating federal export controls.\nUnder an obscure set of US regulations known as the International Trade in Arms Regulations (ITAR), Wilson was accused of exporting weapons without a license, just as if he’d shipped his plastic gun to Mexico rather than put a digital version of it on the internet.\nHe took Defcad.com offline, but his lawyer warned him that he still potentially faced millions of dollars in fines and years in prison simply for having made the file available to overseas downloaders for a few days.\n“I thought my life was over,” Wilson says.\n…\nTwo months ago, the Department of Justice quietly offered Wilson a settlement to end a lawsuit he and a group of co-plaintiffs have pursued since 2015 against the United States government.\nWilson and his team of lawyers focused their legal argument on a free speech claim: They pointed out that by forbidding Wilson from posting his 3-D-printable data, the State Department was not only violating his right to bear arms but his right to freely share information.\nBy blurring the line between a gun and a digital file, Wilson had also successfully blurred the lines between the Second Amendment and the First.\nStraight Talk on Armed...

{"prompt":"Agencies scramble to prep Russia probe files for release after sweeping Trump order\n\nIntelligence agencies were scrambling Tuesday to comply with a sweeping order by President Trump to declassify key documents that could shed light on the origins of the Russia collusion probe that has hamstrung the administration for more than 18 months.\n\nThe documents Trump ordered declassified involve a renewed Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against former campaign aide Carter Page and text messages from disgraced former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.\n\n\nThe president on Monday afternoon ordered that the documents be released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department “[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency,” according to a statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.\n\nIt is not immediately clear how and when the documents will be released, but by Monday evening, intelligence agencies said they had already begun working to prepare the documents.\n\n“When the President issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House Counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America’s national security interests,” a Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News.\n“The Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President’s order.”\n\nODNI spokeswoman Kellie Wade also said that the agency was “working expeditiously with our interagency partners to conduct a declassification review of the documents the President has identified for declassification.”\n\nThe documents include all FBI reports on interviews, also known as 302s, with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with applications to surveil Carter Page, as well as 21 pages of one renewed warrant.\nThe 21 pages make up only a small portion of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in a heavily redacted format.\nThe June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year.\n\nThe president also ordered the release of unredacted text messages from fired FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, former FBI counsel Lisa Page, former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\n\nThe president for months has blasted Strzok and Page for the bias revealed in their text messages, as well as Comey and McCabe for their leadership of the FBI.\nComey was fired from the bureau in May 2017; McCabe was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in March; Page left the bureau in May; and Strzok was fired last month.\nA source familiar with the timing of the declassification told Fox News they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first, followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr.\n\nThe source added that the Justice Department is working on a \"compressed timeline\" and they expect the first release of records in days or sooner.\nThe text messages are expected to take longer because of the sheer number involved and the fact that Trump ordered their release without redactions.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., are touting the president’s order, saying it covers “pretty much everything that he wanted…and the text messages are a bonus,” a source said of Nunes.\n\nCongressional Republicans are hoping the files reveal details about the start of the Russia investigation led by the FBI, which evolved into Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut Democrats,including the committee’s ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., are blasting the declassification order as a “clear abuse of power.”\n\n\"[Trump] has decided to intervene in a pending law enforcement investigation by ordering the selective release of materials he believes are helpful to his defense team and thinks will advance a false narrative,\" Schiff said.\n\"With respect to some of these materials, I have been previously informed by the FBI and Justice Department that they would consider their release a red line that must not be crossed as they may compromise sources and methods.\n\n\"This is evidently of no consequence to a President who cares about nothing about the country and everything about his narrow self-interest,\" Schiff added.\n\nThe president’s order is similar to his February move, when he cleared the way for the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee to release a partisan memo about the surveillance warrant on Carter Page.\nDemocrats, weeks later, released their own version of the memo.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|2650|2661\nLoaded_Language|4098|4110\nName_Calling,Labeling|4661|4760\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3368|3380\nLoaded_Language|0|17\nLoaded_Language|107|122\nLoaded_Language|282|338\nName_Calling,Labeling|510|540\nName_Calling,Labeling|2478|2501\nLoaded_Language|3557|3590\nCausal_Oversimplification|4170|4377\nLoaded_Language|4540|4575\nDoubt|4622|4760\nName_Calling,Labeling|4920|4935\nName_Calling,Labeling|4144|4164."}
{"prompt":"Rep. Danny Davis was For\/Against\/For\/Against Farrakhan\n\nRep. Danny Davis helped get the ball rolling by praising Farrakhan.\nDemocratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis defended Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as an “outstanding human being” on Monday.\nFarrakhan’s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks, saying white people “deserve to die” and praising Adolf Hitler as a “very great man.” “I personally know [Farrakhan], I’ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,” Davis told TheDC.\n“I don’t regard Louis Farrakhan as an aberration or anything, I regard him as an outstanding human being who commands a following of individuals who are learned and articulate and he plays a big role in the lives of thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people,” he emphasized later.\nThen Rep.

Davis' current views.\nHe likes a racist hate group.\nBut doesn't believe white people are devils or Jews are satanic.\nWhoever the JTA has on the \"explain away Farrakhan's Dem fandom\" beat is going to be busy again.\nBut this is typical of the Dems and their useful idiots.\nAnd J Street is on record as endorsing a politician who praised a racist hate group leader and discussed the \"Jewish question.\"\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|2410|2465\nName_Calling,Labeling|2428|2434\nName_Calling,Labeling|2458|2465\nName_Calling,Labeling|2682|2705\nName_Calling,Labeling|2953|2959\nName_Calling,Labeling|2972|2979\nName_Calling,Labeling|3120|3133\nSlogans|374|389\nExaggeration,Minimisation|744|800\nExaggeration,Minimisation|642|665\nExaggeration,Minimisation|422|438\nExaggeration,Minimisation|216|240\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2342|2359\nDoubt|2710|2754\nAppeal_to_Authority|440|860\nThought-terminating_Cliches|1854|1958\nName_Calling,Labeling|2300|2334\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|2477|2707\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|2708|2847\nName_Calling,Labeling|3174|3262."}
