{"prompt":"South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day\n\nDavid Duke, the white supremacist icon and former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, has been denounced by many as a hatemonger, and rightfully so.\nHowever, one individual who represents the Muslim community of South Florida, Sofian Zakkout, is enamored with Duke and has been promoting Duke’s bigoted work for many years.\nLast month, once again, Zakkout chose to showcase this work by posting four consecutive Duke videos on his (Zakkout’s) personal Facebook page.\nThe postings can be rivaled only by Zakkout’s own documented bigotry.\nSofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA).\nHe has ties to two dozen mosques stretching from Palm Beach County down to Miami-Dade.\nOn September 21, 2017, Zakkout took to Facebook and posted four David Duke videos.\nThree of the videos were put out by Duke’s official website, DavidDuke.com, one referring to CNN news anchor Wolf Blitzer as a “Jewish Zionist Agent.” The fourth video was a news report featuring a clip of Duke being interviewed at a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia this past August.\nAt this same rally, a white nationalist plowed his car into a group of people who were protesting the rally, killing one.\nThis was not the first time Zakkout has promoted David Duke.\nIndeed, he has done so for years.\nIn February 2016, Zakkout publicized on his Facebook page a bizarre Duke report, titled in part ‘Dr.\nDavid Duke Exposes the Real Racist Jewish Supremacists Who Orchestrate the Destruction of European Mankind…’ Above the posting, Zakkout wrote of Duke, “I respect him for his honesty!”\nIn October 2015, Zakkout posted to Facebook a Duke video, within which Duke makes the wild claim that there has been a “complete takeover of American foreign policy and… American politics by Jewish extremists.” Above the video on Facebook, Zakkout praised Duke, exclaiming “David Duke, a man to believe in!”\nIn July 2010, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring another anti-Semitic Duke video on the AMANA website.\nThe ADL described the video as “venomous.” Currently, AMANA’s official website contains one more Duke video.\nDavid Duke’s bigoted and inciting material is not the only hate Zakkout promotes.\nHe also pedals much bigotry coming from others, including himself.\nIn July 2017, Zakkout posted on his Facebook page a four-minute portion of a speech given by Louis Farrakhan at the Nation of Islam’s February 2017 Saviors’ Day.\nOn the video, Farrakhan repeatedly refers to Jews as “Satan.” He states to his audience: “Really, they’re not Jews.\nNo, that’s Satan.\nYou should learn to call them by their real name, ‘Satan.’ You’re coming face to face with Satan, the Arch Deceiver, the enemy of God, and the enemy of the righteous.”\nIn June 2016, Zakkout clicked ‘like’ under someone else’s Facebook posting (on Zakkout’s personal Facebook page) of a grotesque cartoon containing a worried-looking religious Jew hiding behind an animated tree with a bearded man brandishing a rifle coming towards them.\nThe tree is speaking to the man in Arabic, saying “Oh Muslim!\nOh Muslim!\nThere is a Jew behind me.\nCome and kill him.”\nIn April 2016, Zakkout promoted a report discussing the absurd notion of Jewish involvement in the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\nA photo from the report shows the burning towers with a Jewish Star affixed to one.\nThe report begins, “It ain’t debatable!\nSoup to nuts, top to bottom, the 9\/11\/01 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington D.C. were an ‘Israeli’-Jewish job.” The website which published the report and which Zakkout linked to is Mouqawamah Music, a site that openly calls for “Death to Israel” and labels the Jewish religion “wicked and filth-ridden.”\nIn February 2016, Zakkout circulated on social media a report claiming that “the Holocaust was faked.” It begins: “The alleged ‘Holocaust’ of ‘6 million Jews’ at the hands of Adolf Hitler and National Socialist Germany during WWII is the biggest lie ever foisted upon humanity.” It was produced by The Realist Report, an anti-Jew, anti-black, anti-gay independent media outlet, which describes Hitler as “the greatest leader in modern Western history.”\nIn December 2015, Zakkout posted a photo of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot, who is a decorated veteran of many different wars and battles fought by Israel over the last three-plus decades.\nAbove the picture of Eizenkot, Zakkout wrote in Arabic, “You’re a Jew, the grandson of a monkey and a pig.” He signed it “Sofian.” This is one of many times Zakkout has referred to Jews as “monkeys and pigs.”\nIn July 2014, Zakkout organized a pro-Hamas rally held outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Miami.\nOn video, Zakkout is shown smiling, as event goers repeatedly shout, “We are Hamas.” After the rally, Zakkout wrote the following in Arabic, above photos from the event: “Thank God, every day we conquer the American Jews like our conquests over the Jews of Israel!” He signed it “Br.\nSofian Zakkout.”\nSouth Florida Muslim leader Sofian Zakkout’s promotion of bigotry, whether borrowed from others or his own, has been evident for years.\nYet, there is no outcry from the community, not from Muslims, not from non-Muslims.\nIt has been virtually ignored by everyone, save this author and his colleague, Director of Militant Islam Monitor Beila Rabinowitz.\nDespite their having been notified by this author about Zakkout’s perfidious activities, Zakkout remains an active member of the boards of Citizens’ Crime Watch of Miami-Dade County and Crime Stoppers of Miami-Dade County.\nThese organizations have provided and continue to provide Zakkout with a facade of respectability.\nIn reality, he has done nothing to serve the community and only attempts to divide it with his hatemongering.\nIt is time for Zakkout to be exposed and stripped of his public functions.\nIf people like David Duke and Louis Farrakhan can be condemned and repudiated for spreading their toxic hate, their fan and propagator Zakkout can and must be as well.\nBeila Rabinowitz, Director of Militant Islam Monitor, contributed to this report.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Madagascar Outbreak: It Is ‘Inevitable’ The Plague Becomes Resistant To Drugs\n\nThe newest warning about the outbreak of the airborne pneumonic plague, or black death, in Madagascar has been released.\nOfficials warn that it’s inevitable that this bacterial infection that’s infected over 2000 people will become resistant to antibiotics.\nThe only way to treat a person who has contracted the plague is with antibiotics.\nBut experts now warn that because they are being used so much to treat the infection, antibiotics resistance is inevitable and making this disease much more terrifying.\nOnce the bacteria is resistant, the Madagascar healthcare system will be overwhelmed, and the disease will have control of the nation.\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Madagascar’s healthcare system will be unable to cope if the deadly plague outbreak continues to escalate, a scientist has warned.\nScores of doctors and nurses have been struck down with the disease, which is predicted to gather momentum in the coming weeks and there are growing fears hospitals will be unable to meet the illness’ burden.\nOfficial figures reveal at least 2,034 people have been infected with the “medieval disease” so far in what has been described as the “worst outbreak in 50 years.” The black death outbreak has so far claimed at least 165 lives.\nAlthough the plague is responding well to antibiotics right now, drug resistance is also an increasing concern amongst experts who predict it will vastly accelerate the disease’s death toll.\nProfessor John Joe McFadden from the University of Surrey told MailOnline: “Fortunately in [the] plague, it has not developed much antibiotic resistance.\nIf that kicks in, the plague will be far, far scarier.\nIf you throw more and more antibiotics at patients, antibiotic resistance is more or less inevitable.”\nDr. Derek Gatherer, from Lancaster University’s biomedical and life-sciences department, told MailOnline the country would struggle “to cope” if cases continue to spiral.\n“Madagascar, typically like many African countries, doesn’t have many doctors.\nThere are around three-and-a-half thousand doctors for 22 million people.\nThey only have around 6,000 hospital beds, so they aren’t particularly well positioned to cope with these kind of events.\nAnd if it wasn’t for the international aid coming in things would definitely be much worse for them.”\nAnd experts continue to fear the healthcare system is on the brink of being overwhelmed.\nShould the disease actually spread to the African mainland, it will be all but impossible to control and the health care system would certainly be unable to handle the outbreak at that point, making a global pandemic much more likely.\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|154|165\nAppeal_to_Authority|21|77\nRepetition|220|265\nRepetition|505|541\nAppeal_to_Authority|752|857\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1222|1253\nName_Calling,Labeling|1260|1271\nRepetition|1385|1430\nRepetition|1772|1820\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|546|586\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1665|1718\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|2652|2693."}

{"prompt":"Former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States Accuses Pope of McCarrick Cover-up, Calls on Francis to Resign\n\nIn this tragic moment for the Church in various parts of the world — the United States, Chile, Honduras, Australia, etc.\n— bishops have a very grave responsibility.\nI am thinking in particular of the United States of America, where I was sent as Apostolic Nuncio by Pope Benedict XVI on October 19, 2011, the memorial feast of the First North American Martyrs.\nThe Bishops of the United States are called, and I with them, to follow the example of these first martyrs who brought the Gospel to the lands of America, to be credible witnesses of the immeasurable love of Christ, the Way, the Truth and the Life.\nAlso, as this is an unprecedented moment in papal history, perhaps the unprecedented step of recalling Benedict XVI to the Chair of St. Peter should also be considered sooner rather than later, before this crisis gets any more out-of-control than it already is.\nMay God save His Church MJM\nSo serious is the cover-up that for the good of the Church and protection of the faithful, Archbishop Vigano has called on Pope Francis to resign.\nBut before Francis resigns, we the Catholic faithful demand that he also remove from the College of Cardinals those who conspired even before the 2013 conclave to make Jorge Mario Bergoglio pope come hell or high water.\nHe and the St. Gallen Group know exactly who they are.\nArchbishop Carlo Maria Viganò's 11-page statement, released to the National Catholic Register, accuses Pope Francis of covering for McCarrick, ignoring the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on McCarrick, and also of making McCarrick a trusted counselor who became Francis's \"kingmaker\" when it came to American appointments and was highly instrumental in the Pope's decision to elevate far-Left bishops such as Blase Cupich of Chicago and Joseph Tobin of Newark to the College of Cardinals.\nRemnant Editor's Note: This could well mark the beginning of the end of the disastrous pontificate of Pope Francis.\nThe former apostolic nuncio to the United States has accused Francis of repealing sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI on then-Cardinal McCarrick for sexual abuse.\nThis is a charge most serious, perhaps without precedent in modern times.\nBishops and priests, abusing their authority, have committed horrendous crimes to the detriment of their faithful, minors, innocent victims, and young men eager to offer their lives to the Church, or by their silence have not prevented that such crimes continue to be perpetrated.\nTo restore the beauty of holiness to the face of the Bride of Christ, which is terribly disfigured by so many abominable crimes, and if we truly want to free the Church from the fetid swamp into which she has fallen, we must have the courage to tear down the culture of secrecy and publicly confess the truths we have kept hidden.\nWe must tear down the conspiracy of silence with which bishops and priests have protected themselves at the expense of their faithful, a conspiracy of silence that in the eyes of the world risks making the Church look like a sect, a conspiracy of silence not so dissimilar from the one that prevails in the mafia.\n“Whatever you have said in the dark ... shall be proclaimed from the housetops” (Lk.\n12:3).\nI had always believed and hoped that the hierarchy of the Church could find within itself the spiritual resources and strength to tell the whole truth, to amend and to renew itself.\nThat is why, even though I had repeatedly been asked to do so, I always avoided making statements to the media, even when it would have been my right to do so, in order to defend myself against the calumnies published about me, even by high-ranking prelates of the Roman Curia.\nBut now that the corruption has reached the very top of the Church’s hierarchy, my conscience dictates that I reveal those truths regarding the heart-breaking case of the Archbishop Emeritus of Washington, D.C., Theodore McCarrick, which I came to know in the course of the duties entrusted to me by St. John Paul II, as Delegate for Pontifical Representations, from 1998 to 2009, and by Pope Benedict XVI, as Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America, from October 19, 2011 until end of May 2016.\nAs Delegate for Pontifical Representations in the Secretariat of State, my responsibilities were not limited to the Apostolic Nunciatures, but also included the staff of the Roman Curia (hires, promotions, informational processes on candidates to the episcopate, etc.)\nand the examination of delicate cases, including those regarding cardinals and bishops, that were entrusted to the Delegate by the Cardinal Secretary of State or by the Substitute of the Secretariat of State.\nTo dispel suspicions insinuated in several recent articles, I will immediately say that the Apostolic Nuncios in the United States, Gabriel Montalvo and Pietro Sambi, both prematurely deceased, did not fail to inform the Holy See immediately, as soon as they learned of Archbishop McCarrick’s gravely immoral behavior with seminarians and priests.\nIndeed, according to what Nuncio Pietro Sambi wrote, Father Boniface Ramsey, O.P.’s letter, dated November 22, 2000, was written at the request of the late Nuncio Montalvo.\nIn the letter, Father Ramsey, who had been a professor at the diocesan seminary in Newark from the end of the ’80s until 1996, affirms that there was a recurring rumor in the seminary that the Archbishop “shared his bed with seminarians,” inviting five at a time to spend the weekend with him at his beach house.\nAnd he added that he knew a certain number of seminarians, some of whom were later ordained priests for the Archdiocese of Newark, who had been invited to this beach house and had shared a bed with the Archbishop.\nThe office that I held at the time was not informed of any measure taken by the Holy See after those charges were brought by Nuncio Montalvo at the end of 2000, when Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State.\nLikewise, Nuncio Sambi transmitted to the Cardinal Secretary of State, Tarcisio Bertone, an Indictment Memorandum against McCarrick by the priest Gregory Littleton of the diocese of Charlotte, who was reduced to the lay state for a violation of minors, together with two documents from the same Littleton, in which he recounted his tragic story of sexual abuse by the then-Archbishop of Newark and several other priests and seminarians.\nThe Nuncio added that Littleton had already forwarded his Memorandum to about twenty people, including civil and ecclesiastical judicial authorities, police and lawyers, in June 2006, and that it was therefore very likely that the news would soon be made public.\nHe therefore called for a prompt intervention by the Holy See.\nIn writing up a memo[1] on these documents that were entrusted to me, as Delegate for Pontifical Representations, on December 6, 2006, I wrote to my superiors, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone and the Substitute Leonardo Sandri, that the facts attributed to McCarrick by Littleton were of such gravity and vileness as to provoke bewilderment, a sense of disgust, deep sorrow and bitterness in the reader, and that they constituted the crimes of seducing, requesting depraved acts of seminarians and priests, repeatedly and simultaneously with several people, derision of a young seminarian who tried to resist the Archbishop’s seductions in the presence of two other priests, absolution of the accomplices in these depraved acts, sacrilegious celebration of the Eucharist with the same priests after committing such acts.\nIn my memo, which I delivered on that same December 6, 2006 to my direct superior, the Substitute Leonardo Sandri, I proposed the following considerations and course of action to my superiors:\n- Given that it seemed a new scandal of particular gravity, as it regarded a cardinal, was going to be added to the many scandals for the Church in the United States,\n- and that, since this matter had to do with a cardinal, and according to can.\n1405 § 1, No.\n2˚, “ipsius Romani Pontificis dumtaxat ius est iudicandi”;\n- I proposed that an exemplary measure be taken against the Cardinal that could have a medicinal function, to prevent future abuses against innocent victims and alleviate the very serious scandal for the faithful, who despite everything continued to love and believe in the Church.\nI added that it would be salutary if, for once, ecclesiastical authority would intervene before the civil authorities and, if possible, before the scandal had broken out in the press.\nThis could have restored some dignity to a Church so sorely tried and humiliated by so many abominable acts on the part of some pastors.\nIf this were done, the civil authority would no longer have to judge a cardinal, but a pastor with whom the Church had already taken appropriate measures to prevent the cardinal from abusing his authority and continuing to destroy innocent victims.\nMy memo of December 6, 2006 was kept by my superiors, and was never returned to me with any actual decision by the superiors on this matter.\nSubsequently, around April 21-23, 2008, the Statement for Pope Benedict XVI about the pattern of sexual abuse crisis in the United States, by Richard Sipe, was published on the internet, at richardsipe.com.\nOn April 24, it was passed on by the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal William Levada, to the Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone.\nIt was delivered to me one month later, on May 24, 2008.\nThe following day, I delivered a new memo to the new Substitute, Fernando Filoni, which included my previous one of December 6, 2006.\nIn it, I summarized Richard Sipe’s document, which ended with this respectful and heartfelt appeal to Pope Benedict XVI: “I approach Your Holiness with due reverence, but with the same intensity that motivated Peter Damian to lay out before your predecessor, Pope Leo IX, a description of the condition of the clergy during his time.\nThe problems he spoke of are similar and as great now in the United States as they were then in Rome.\nIf Your Holiness requests, I will personally submit to you documentation of that about which I have spoken.”\nI ended my memo by repeating to my superiors that I thought it was necessary to intervene as soon as possible by removing the cardinal’s hat from Cardinal McCarrick and that he should be subjected to the sanctions established by the Code of Canon Law, which also provide for reduction to the lay state.\nThis second memo of mine was also never returned to the Personnel Office, and I was greatly dismayed at my superiors for the inconceivable absence of any measure against the Cardinal, and for the continuing lack of any communication with me since my first memo in December 2006.\nBut finally I learned with certainty, through Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, then-Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, that Richard Sipe’s courageous and meritorious Statement had had the desired result.\nPope Benedict had imposed on Cardinal McCarrick sanctions similar to those now imposed on him by Pope Francis: the Cardinal was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.\nI do not know when Pope Benedict took these measures against McCarrick, whether in 2009 or 2010, because in the meantime I had been transferred to the Governorate of Vatican City State, just as I do not know who was responsible for this incredible delay.\nI certainly do not believe it was Pope Benedict, who as Cardinal had repeatedly denounced the corruption present in the Church, and in the first months of his pontificate had already taken a firm stand against the admission into seminary of young men with deep homosexual tendencies.\nI believe it was due to the Pope’s first collaborator at the time, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who notoriously favored promoting homosexuals into positions of responsibility, and was accustomed to managing the information he thought appropriate to convey to the Pope.\nIn any case, what is certain is that Pope Benedict imposed the above canonical sanctions on McCarrick and that they were communicated to him by the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi.\nMonsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, then first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington and Chargé d'Affaires a.i.\nafter the unexpected death of Nuncio Sambi in Baltimore, told me when I arrived in Washington — and he is ready to testify to it— about a stormy conversation, lasting over an hour, that Nuncio Sambi had with Cardinal McCarrick whom he had summoned to the Nunciature.\nMonsignor Lantheaume told me that “the Nuncio’s voice could be heard all the way out in the corridor.”\nPope Benedict’s same dispositions were then also communicated to me by the new Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Marc Ouellet, in November 2011, in a conversation before my departure for Washington, and were included among the instructions of the same Congregation to the new Nuncio.\nIn turn, I repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature.\nThe Cardinal, muttering in a barely comprehensible way, admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance.\nThe faithful insistently wonder how it was possible for him to be appointed to Washington, and as Cardinal, and they have every right to know who knew, and who covered up his grave misdeeds.\nIt is therefore my duty to reveal what I know about this, beginning with the Roman Curia.\nCardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information was communicated to him.\nIn November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick.\nIt is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end.\nHe even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up.\nSodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed.\nBenedict reacted, despite Sodano’s strenuous defense, and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned.\nWas McCarrick’s appointment to Washington and as Cardinal the work of Sodano, when John Paul II was already very ill?\nWe are not given to know.\nHowever, it is legitimate to think so, but I do not think he was the only one responsible for this.\nMcCarrick frequently went to Rome and made friends everywhere, at all levels of the Curia.\nIf Sodano had protected Maciel, as seems certain, there is no reason why he wouldn’t have done so for McCarrick, who according to many had the financial means to influence decisions.\nHis nomination to Washington was opposed by then-Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.\nAt the Nunciature in Washington there is a note, written in his hand, in which Cardinal Re disassociates himself from the appointment and states that McCarrick was 14th on the list for Washington.\nNuncio Sambi’s report, with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State.\nMy two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute.\nAs already mentioned, the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals — I cite only the well-known case of Vincenzo de Mauro, who was appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians — and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict.\nCardinal Pietro Parolin, the current Secretary of State, was also complicit in covering up the misdeeds of McCarrick who had, after the election of Pope Francis, boasted openly of his travels and missions to various continents.\nIn April 2014, the Washington Times had a front page report on McCarrick’s trip to the Central African Republic, and on behalf of the State Department no less.\nAs Nuncio to Washington, I wrote to Cardinal Parolin asking him if the sanctions imposed on McCarrick by Pope Benedict were still valid.\nÇa va sans dire that my letter never received any reply!\nThe same can be said for Cardinal William Levada, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, for Cardinals Marc Ouellet, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Lorenzo Baldisseri, former Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops, and Archbishop Ilson de Jesus Montanari, current Secretary of the same Congregation.\nThey were all aware by reason of their office of the sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict on McCarrick.\nCardinals Leonardo Sandri, Fernando Filoni and Angelo Becciu, as Substitutes of the Secretariat of State, knew in every detail the situation regarding Cardinal McCarrick.\nNor could Cardinals Giovanni Lajolo and Dominique Mamberti have failed to know.\nAs Secretaries for Relations with States, they participated several times a week in collegial meetings with the Secretary of State.\nAs far as the Roman Curia is concerned, for the moment I will stop here, even if the names of other prelates in the Vatican are well known, even some very close to Pope Francis, such as Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio and Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, who belong to the homosexual current in favor of subverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality, a current already denounced in 1986 by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then-Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in the Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons.\nCardinals Edwin Frederick O’Brien and Renato Raffaele Martino also belong to the same current, albeit with a different ideology.\nOthers belonging to this current even reside at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.\nNow to the United States.\nObviously, the first to have been informed of the measures taken by Pope Benedict was McCarrick’s successor in Washington See, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, whose situation is now completely compromised by the recent revelations regarding his behavior as Bishop of Pittsburgh.\nIt is absolutely unthinkable that Nunzio Sambi, who was an extremely responsible person, loyal, direct and explicit in his way of being (a true son of Romagna) did not speak to him about it.\nIn any case, I myself brought up the subject with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn’t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it.\nI also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick.\nI immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it.\nIf, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained?\nHis recent statements that he knew nothing about it, even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims, are absolutely laughable.\nThe Cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his Chancellor, Monsignor Antonicelli, to lie as well.\nCardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion.\nFollowing a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters.\nBefore forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written.\nThe Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it.\nHowever, he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters, contrary to what he customarily did.\nI subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years.\nBut the Cardinal knew nothing about it!\nCardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope’s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C.\nIn doing so, he put other seminarians at risk.\nBishop Paul Bootkoski, emeritus of Metuchen, and Archbishop John Myers, emeritus of Newark, covered up the abuses committed by McCarrick in their respective dioceses and compensated two of his victims.\nThey cannot deny it and they must be interrogated in order to reveal every circumstance and all responsibility regarding this matter.\nCardinal Kevin Farrell, who was recently interviewed by the media, also said that he didn’t have the slightest idea about the abuses committed by McCarrick.\nGiven his tenure in Washington, Dallas and now Rome, I think no one can honestly believe him.\nI don’t know if he was ever asked if he knew about Maciel’s crimes.\nIf he were to deny this, would anybody believe him given that he occupied positions of responsibility as a member of the Legionaries of Christ?\nRegarding Cardinal Sean O’Malley, I would simply say that his latest statements on the McCarrick case are disconcerting, and have totally obscured his transparency and credibility.\n* * *\nMy conscience requires me also to reveal facts that I have experienced personally, concerning Pope Francis, that have a dramatic significance, which as Bishop, sharing the collegial responsibility of all the bishops for the universal Church, do not allow me to remain silent, and that I state here, ready to reaffirm them under oath by calling on God as my witness.\nIn the last months of his pontificate, Pope Benedict XVI had convened a meeting of all the apostolic nuncios in Rome, as Paul VI and St. John Paul II had done on several occasions.\nThe date set for the audience with the Pope was Friday, June 21, 2013.\nPope Francis kept this commitment made by his predecessor.\nOf course I also came to Rome from Washington.\nIt was my first meeting with the new Pope elected only three months prior, after the resignation of Pope Benedict.\nOn the morning of Thursday, June 20, 2013, I went to the Domus Sanctae Marthae, to join my colleagues who were staying there.\nAs soon as I entered the hall I met Cardinal McCarrick, who wore the red-trimmed cassock.\nI greeted him respectfully as I had always done.\nHe immediately said to me, in a tone somewhere between ambiguous and triumphant: “The Pope received me yesterday, tomorrow I am going to China.”\nAt the time I knew nothing of his long friendship with Cardinal Bergoglio and of the important part he had played in his recent election, as McCarrick himself would later reveal in a lecture at Villanova University and in an interview with the National Catholic Reporter.\nNor had I ever thought of the fact that he had participated in the preliminary meetings of the recent conclave, and of the role he had been able to have as a cardinal elector in the 2005 conclave.\nTherefore I did not immediately grasp the meaning of the encrypted message that McCarrick had communicated to me, but that would become clear to me in the days immediately following.\nThe next day the audience with Pope Francis took place.\nAfter his address, which was partly read and partly delivered off the cuff, the Pope wished to greet all the nuncios one by one.\nIn single file, I remember that I was among the last.\nWhen it was my turn, I just had time to say to him, “I am the Nuncio to the United States.” He immediately assailed me with a tone of reproach, using these words: “The Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized!\nThey must be shepherds!”Of course I was not in a position to ask for explanations about the meaning of his words and the aggressive way in which he had upbraided me.\nI had in my hand a book in Portuguese that Cardinal O’Malley had sent me for the Pope a few days earlier, telling me “so he could go over his Portuguese before going to Rio for World Youth Day.” I handed it to him immediately, and so freed myself from that extremely disconcerting and embarrassing situation.\nAt the end of the audience the Pope announced: “Those of you who are still in Rome next Sunday are invited to concelebrate with me at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.” I naturally thought of staying on to clarify as soon as possible what the Pope intended to tell me.\nOn Sunday June 23, before the concelebration with the Pope, I asked Monsignor Ricca, who as the person in charge of the house helped us put on the vestments, if he could ask the Pope if he could receive me sometime in the following week.\nHow could I have returned to Washington without having clarified what the Pope wanted of me?\nAt the end of Mass, while the Pope was greeting the few lay people present, Monsignor Fabian Pedacchio, his Argentine secretary, came to me and said: “The Pope told me to ask if you are free now!” Naturally, I replied that I was at the Pope’s disposal and that I thanked him for receiving me immediately.\nThe Pope took me to the first floor in his apartment and said: “We have 40 minutes before the Angelus.”\nI began the conversation, asking the Pope what he intended to say to me with the words he had addressed to me when I greeted him the previous Friday.\nAnd the Pope, in a very different, friendly, almost affectionate tone, said to me: “Yes, the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing like the Archbishop of Philadelphia, (the Pope did not give me the name of the Archbishop) they must be shepherds; and they must not be left-wing — and he added, raising both arms — and when I say left-wing I mean homosexual.” Of course, the logic of the correlation between being left-wing and being homosexual escaped me, but I added nothing else.\nImmediately after, the Pope asked me in a deceitful way: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” I answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naiveté: “Holy Father, I don’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him.\nHe corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.” The Pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face, as if he had already known the matter for some time, and he immediately changed the subject.\nBut then, what was the Pope’s purpose in asking me that question: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not.\nBack in Washington everything became very clear to me, thanks also to a new event that occurred only a few days after my meeting with Pope Francis.\nWhen the new Bishop Mark Seitz took possession of the Diocese of El Paso on July 9, 2013, I sent the first Counsellor, Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, while I went to Dallas that same day for an international meeting on Bioethics.\nWhen he got back, Monsignor Lantheaume told me that in El Paso he had met Cardinal McCarrick who, taking him aside, told him almost the same words that the Pope had said to me in Rome: “the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing, they must be shepherds….” I was astounded!\nIt was therefore clear that the words of reproach that Pope Francis had addressed to me on June 21, 2013 had been put into his mouth the day before by Cardinal McCarrick.\nAlso the Pope’s mention “not like the Archbishop of Philadelphia” could be traced to McCarrick, because there had been a strong disagreement between the two of them about the admission to Communion of pro-abortion politicians.\nIn his communication to the bishops, McCarrick had manipulated a letter of then-Cardinal Ratzinger who prohibited giving them Communion.\nIndeed, I also knew how certain Cardinals such as Mahony, Levada and Wuerl, were closely linked to McCarrick; they had opposed the most recent appointments made by Pope Benedict, for important posts such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, Denver and San Francisco.\nNot happy with the trap he had set for me on June 23, 2013, when he asked me about McCarrick, only a few months later, in the audience he granted me on October 10, 2013, Pope Francis set a second one for me, this time concerning a second of his protégés, Cardinal Donald Wuerl.\nHe asked me: “What is Cardinal Wuerl like, is he good or bad?” I replied, “Holy Father, I will not tell you if he is good or bad, but I will tell you two facts.” They are the ones I have already mentioned above, which concern Wuerl’s pastoral carelessness regarding the aberrant deviations at Georgetown University and the invitation by the Archdiocese of Washington to young aspirants to the priesthood to a meeting with McCarrick!\nOnce again the Pope did not show any reaction.\nIt was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis’s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews.\nIn a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, he had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States, and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration.\nThis is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal.\nWith these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops.\nIn addition, he appointed the Brazilian Ilson de Jesus Montanari — the great friend of his private Argentine secretary Fabian Pedacchio — as Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops and Secretary of the College of Cardinals, promoting him in one single leap from a simple official of that department to Archbishop Secretary.\nSomething unprecedented for such an important position!\nThe appointments of Blase Cupich to Chicago and Joseph W. Tobin to Newark were orchestrated by McCarrick, Maradiaga and Wuerl, united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first, and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two.\nTheir names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.\nRegarding Cupich, one cannot fail to note his ostentatious arrogance, and the insolence with which he denies the evidence that is now obvious to all: that 80% of the abuses found were committed against young adults by homosexuals who were in a relationship of authority over their victims.\nDuring the speech he gave when he took possession of the Chicago See, at which I was present as a representative of the Pope, Cupich quipped that one certainly should not expect the new Archbishop to walk on water.\nPerhaps it would be enough for him to be able to remain with his feet on the ground and not try to turn reality upside-down, blinded by his pro-gay ideology, as he stated in a recent interview with America Magazine.\nExtolling his particular expertise in the matter, having been President of the Committee on Protection of Children and Young People of the USCCB, he asserted that the main problem in the crisis of sexual abuse by clergy is not homosexuality, and that affirming this is only a way of diverting attention from the real problem which is clericalism.\nIn support of this thesis, Cupich “oddly” made reference to the results of research carried out at the height of the sexual abuse of minors crisis in the early 2000s, while he “candidly” ignored that the results of that investigation were totally denied by the subsequent Independent Reports by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in 2004 and 2011, which concluded that, in cases of sexual abuse, 81% of the victims were male.\nIn fact, Father Hans Zollner, S.J., Vice-Rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University, President of the Centre for Child Protection, and Member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, recently told the newspaper La Stampa that “in most cases it is a question of homosexual abuse.”\nThe appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above, with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio, by Cardinal Parolin: “Reserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.” McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick’s abuses, as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28, 2016.\nThese characters are closely associated with individuals belonging in particular to the deviated wing of the Society of Jesus, unfortunately today a majority, which had already been a cause of serious concern to Paul VI and subsequent pontiffs.\nWe need only consider Father Robert Drinan, S.J., who was elected four times to the House of Representatives, and was a staunch supporter of abortion; or Father Vincent O’Keefe, S.J., one of the principal promoters of The Land O’Lakes Statement of 1967, which seriously compromised the Catholic identity of universities and colleges in the United States.\nIt should be noted that McCarrick, then President of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, also participated in that inauspicious undertaking which was so harmful to the formation of the consciences of American youth, closely associated as it was with the deviated wing of the Jesuits.\nFather James Martin, S.J., acclaimed by the people mentioned above, in particular Cupich, Tobin, Farrell and McElroy, appointed Consultor of the Secretariat for Communications, well-known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda, chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families, is nothing but a sad recent example of that deviated wing of the Society of Jesus.\nPope Francis has repeatedly asked for total transparency in the Church and for bishops and faithful to act with parrhesia.\nThe faithful throughout the world also demand this of him in an exemplary manner.\nHe must honestly state when he first learned about the crimes committed by McCarrick, who abused his authority with seminarians and priests.\nIn any case, the Pope learned about it from me on June 23, 2013 and continued to cover for him.\nHe did not take into account the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on him and made him his trusted counselor along with Maradiaga.\nThe latter [Maradiaga] is so confident of the Pope’s protection that he can dismiss as “gossip” the heartfelt appeals of dozens of his seminarians, who found the courage to write to him after one of them tried to commit suicide over homosexual abuse in the seminary.\nBy now the faithful have well understood Maradiaga’s strategy: insult the victims to save himself, lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power, of mismanagement in the administration of Church property, and of financial disasters even against close friends, as in the case of the Ambassador of Honduras Alejandro Valladares, former Dean of the Diplomatic Corps to the Holy See.\nIn the case of the former Auxiliary Bishop Juan José Pineda, after the article published in the [Italian] weekly L’Espresso last February, Maradiaga stated in the newspaper Avvenire: “It was my auxiliary bishop Pineda who asked for the visitation, so as to ‘clear’ his name after being subjected to much slander.” Now, regarding Pineda the only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted, thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere.\nIn the name of the transparency so hailed by the Pope, the report that the Visitator, Argentine bishop Alcides Casaretto, delivered more than a year ago only and directly to the Pope, must be made public.\nFinally, the recent appointment as Substitute of Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra is also connected with Honduras, that is, with Maradiaga.\nFrom 2003 to 2007 Peña Parra worked as Counsellor at the Tegucigalpa Nunciature.\nAs Delegate for Pontifical Representations I received worrisome information about him.\nIn Honduras, a scandal as huge as the one in Chile is about to be repeated.\nThe Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops.\nFirst he insulted the abuse victims.\nThen, only when he was forced by the media, and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful, did he recognize his error and apologize, while stating that he had been misinformed, causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile, but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati.\nEven in the tragic affair of McCarrick, Pope Francis’s behavior was no different.\nHe knew from at least June 23, 2013 that McCarrick was a serial predator.\nAlthough he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end; indeed, he made McCarrick’s advice his own, which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church.\nIt was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action [regarding McCarrick] to save his image in the media.\nNow in the United States a chorus of voices is rising especially from the lay faithful, and has recently been joined by several bishops and priests, asking that all those who, by their silence, covered up McCarrick’s criminal behavior, or who used him to advance their career or promote their intentions, ambitions and power in the Church, should resign.\nBut this will not be enough to heal the situation of extremely grave immoral behavior by the clergy: bishops and priests.\nA time of conversion and penance must be proclaimed.\nThe virtue of chastity must be recovered in the clergy and in seminaries.\nCorruption in the misuse of the Church’s resources and of the offerings of the faithful must be fought against.\nThe seriousness of homosexual behavior must be denounced.\nThe homosexual networks present in the Church must be eradicated, as Janet Smith, Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, recently wrote.\n“The problem of clergy abuse,” she wrote, “cannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops, and even less so by bureaucratic directives.\nThe deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated.” These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.\nI implore everyone, especially Bishops, to speak up in order to defeat this conspiracy of silence that is so widespread, and to report the cases of abuse they know about to the media and civil authorities.\nLet us heed the most powerful message that St. John Paul II left us as an inheritance:Do not be afraid!\nDo not be afraid!\nIn his 2008 homily on the Feast of the Epiphany, Pope Benedict reminded us that the Father’s plan of salvation had been fully revealed and realized in the mystery of Christ’s death and resurrection, but it needs to be welcomed in human history, which is always a history of fidelity on God’s part and unfortunately also of infidelity on the part of us men.\nThe Church, the depositary of the blessing of the New Covenant, signed in the blood of the Lamb, is holy but made up of sinners, as Saint Ambrose wrote: the Church is “immaculata ex maculatis,” she is holy and spotless even though, in her earthly journey, she is made up of men stained with sin.\nI want to recall this indefectible truth of the Church’s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former Archbishop of Washington, Theodore McCarrick; by the grave, disconcerting and sinful conduct of Pope Francis and by the conspiracy of silence of so many pastors, and who are tempted to abandon the Church, disfigured by so many ignominies.\nAt the Angelus on Sunday, August 12, 2018 Pope Francis said these words: “Everyone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ...\nIf we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it.\nWe need to intervene where evil is spreading; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking.” If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer, how much graver is it for the Church’s supreme pastor, who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt.\nHe followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert, thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by McCarrick.\nAnd how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church!\nFrancis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren.\nIndeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ’s flock.\nIn this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick’s abuses and resign along with all of them.\nEven in dismay and sadness over the enormity of what is happening, let us not lose hope!\nWe well know that the great majority of our pastors live their priestly vocation with fidelity and dedication.\nIt is in moments of great trial that the Lord’s grace is revealed in abundance and makes His limitless mercy available to all; but it is granted only to those who are truly repentant and sincerely propose to amend their lives.\nThis is a favorable time for the Church to confess her sins, to convert, and to do penance.\nLet us all pray for the Church and for the Pope, let us remember how many times he has asked us to pray for him!\nLet us all renew faith in the Church our Mother: “I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church!”\nChrist will never abandon His Church!\nHe generated her in His Blood and continually revives her with His Spirit!\nMary, Mother of the Church, pray for us!\nMary, Virgin and Queen, Mother of the King of glory, pray for us!\nRome, August 22, 2018\nQueenship of the Blessed Virgin Mary\nOfficial translation by Diane Montagna.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|7126|7137\nLoaded_Language|19791|19802\nLoaded_Language|6339|6345\nLoaded_Language|7117|7124\nLoaded_Language|19751|19771\nLoaded_Language|40294|40304\nLoaded_Language|21756|21769\nLoaded_Language|21780|21787\nLoaded_Language|29196|29217\nRepetition|39495|39511\nLoaded_Language|117|123\nLoaded_Language|247|257\nLoaded_Language|2005|2015\nLoaded_Language|2228|2240\nLoaded_Language|2645|2664\nLoaded_Language|10594|10610\nLoaded_Language|10932|10958\nLoaded_Language|11592|11602\nLoaded_Language|21957|21965\nLoaded_Language|26848|26858\nLoaded_Language|30672|30678\nLoaded_Language|40268|40286\nName_Calling,Labeling|41236|41243\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|913|979\nLoaded_Language|2346|2356\nLoaded_Language|2676|2693\nRepetition|2897|2904\nLoaded_Language|5039|5063\nLoaded_Language|8923|8930\nLoaded_Language|13636|13650\nLoaded_Language|24320|24330\nLoaded_Language|30487|30500\nLoaded_Language|30891|30913\nLoaded_Language|35346|35355\nLoaded_Language|37049|37059\nLoaded_Language|37308|37323\nExaggeration,Minimisation|38123|38138\nLoaded_Language|38139|38155\nSlogans|39477|39493\nLoaded_Language|40148|40164\nLoaded_Language|40423|40429\nRepetition|42861|42872\nRepetition|42927|42938."}
{"prompt":"Asteroid Will Skim By Earth Days Before Christmas: It Is ‘Potentially Hazardous’\n\nAn asteroid called 3200 Phaethon will skim past the Earth just days before many will celebrate with Christmas festivities.\nThe three-mile-wide asteroid is expected to miss the Earth, but it’s still labeled as “potentially hazardous,” and for good reasons.\nWith a diameter of about 3 miles, the asteroid named 3200 Phaethon (after the Greek demi-god who, according to legend, nearly set the Earth on fire) is classified as “potentially hazardous” by the Minor Planet Center.\nThe asteroid will pass within 6.5 million miles of the Earth, which is relatively close in space terms, but still around 27 times the distance of the moon.\nMuch closer flybys have occurred in the very recent past.\nScientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory are planning to use the opportunity to obtain a detailed 3D model of the asteroid, which has a particularly irregular shape.\nFirst detected in December 2007, 3200 Phaethon is widely thought to be the parent body for the Geminid meteor shower, which is due to peak this year on the night of December 13.\nThis would make the Geminids one of only two major meteor showers not originating from a comet; the other being the Quadrantids in January.\nThe main difference between asteroids and comets is their composition.\nAsteroids are made up of metals and rocky material, while comets are made up of ice, dust and rocky material.\nComets which approach the Sun lose material with each orbit because some of their ice melts and vaporizes to form a tail.\nBut the real question is will anyone be able to see the asteroid’s close approach to our planet.\nAccording to NASA, 3200 Phaethon will be visible in small telescopes for experienced observers in areas with dark skies.\nIt is potentially detectable for three weeks but will be at its brightest between December 11 and 21.\nIf you don’t see the asteroid itself, be sure to look out for the Geminid meteor shower, which is set to provide a spectacular show over the course of 10 nights in December, with as many as 100 shooting stars every hour.\n>","completion":" Repetition|505|526\nLoaded_Language|1996|2014."}
{"prompt":"New outbreak of Ebola kills 17 in northwest DR Congo\n\nSeventeen people in northwest Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have died from Ebola, the health ministry said on Tuesday, describing the fresh outbreak as a \"public health emergency with international impact.\"\n\"Twenty-one cases of fever with haemorrhagic indications and 17 deaths\" have been recorded in Equateur province, it said, citing a notification to the ministry as of May 3.\nIt is the DRC's ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976, when the deady viral disease was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team.\nIn Geneva, the World Health Organization (WHO) said lab tests in the DRC confirmed the presence of Ebola virus in two out of five samples collected from patients.\n\"WHO is working closely with the government of the DRC to rapidly scale up its operations and mobilize health partners, using the model of a successful response to a similar... outbreak in 2017,\" it said in a statement.\nIt said it had released $1 million (840,000 euros) from an emergency contingency fund, set up a coordination group and deployed more than 50 experts to work with the DRC government and health agencies.\n\"The action plan prepared by the health ministry has been approved,\" an official statement released after a cabinet meeting said.\n- No new deaths -\n\"Since the notification of the cases on May 3, no deaths have been reported,\" it said, without specifying when the first case came to light.\nThe outbreak occurred in Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumba.\nAll the cases were reported from a clinic at Ilkoko Iponge, located about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from Bikoro, where treatment capacities are limited, the WHO said.\nA team of experts from the WHO, Doctors without Borders (DRC) and Equateur province travelled to Bikoro on Tuesday to beef up coordination and carry out investigations, it said.\nEbola is one of the world's most notorious diseases, being both highly infectious and extremely lethal.\nIt is caused by a virus that has a natural reservoir in the bat, which does not itself fall ill, but can pass the microbe on to humans who hunt it for \"bushmeat\".\nThe virus is handed on by contact with bodily fluids -- touching a sick or dead person is a well-known source of infection.\nFollowing an incubation period of between two and 21 days, Ebola develops into a high fever, weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat.\nThat is often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding.\nThe worst-ever Ebola outbreak started in December 2013 in southern Guinea before spreading to two neighbouring west African countries, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\nThat outbreak killed more than 11,300 people out of nearly 29,000 registered cases, according to WHO estimates, although the real figure is thought to be significantly higher.\nMore than 99 percent of victims were in the three West African countries, although cases occurred in other parts of the world, often stirring panic.\nThere is no current vaccine to prevent Ebola or licensed treatment for it, although a range of experimental drugs are in development.\nEarly care with rehydration may boost the chance of survival.\nGiven the lack of a pharmaceutical weapon against Ebola, health experts have responded with time-honoured measures of control, prevention and containment.\nThey use rigorous protocols to protect medical personnel with disposable full-body suits, masks, goggles and gloves and disinfecting sprays.\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_fear-prejudice|214|263\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1928|1966."}

and if you want to learn more about the Quran, ask your parents,’” Penkoski told Christian Post.\nEach religion studied in the class, including Christianity and Judaism, received “equitable treatment,” Branch also told Christian Post.\nHe said the class spent a week and a half on Christianity and Judaism — other religions took one week — and discussed each religion’s beliefs, history and practices.\nDuring the section on Christianity, “Jesus was taught,” Branch claimed.\n“The students read the chapter in our textbook that discusses Christianity’s belief that Jesus is the Son of God, and salvation.\nThey also discussed the Sermon on the Mount, the Last Supper and Jesus’ Betrayal, the Trinity, and the Lord’s Prayer, among other topics,” Branch said.\nPenkoski and his daughter, Brielle, contested Branch’s claims.\nThe Lord’s Prayer was not taught, and very little time was spent teaching about Jesus, they told Christian Post.\n“We did [the unit on Christianity] over a week and two days.\nWe watched two different videos.\nWe didn’t finish them.\nThey taught a little bit about Moses and the Ten Commandments, Peter and Paul,” Brielle explained.\n“We learned about the Israelites and how they are being persecuted by the Romans.\nWe were told about the Jews and told a little bit about Jesus.” Penkoski also shared with Christian Post the packets on Christianity and Judaism passed out in class and allegedly modified from the original full version.\nWhile the packet on Islam contained verses from the Koran, the packets for those religions did not contain scripture and did not encourage students to write prayers or faith statements, he said.\n“Notice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord’s Prayer,” he said.\n“[There’s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet,” he added….\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|339|350\nLoaded_Language|461|467\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1447|1457\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1658|1671\nRepetition|2267|2276\nRepetition|2635|2644."}
{"prompt":"Vote targeting Jewish student politician was not anti-Semitic: McGill report\n\nMONTREAL – It was political disagreement — not anti-Semitism — that led to a Jewish student being voted off the McGill University student council’s board of directors, an investigation ordered by the principal has concluded.\nBut Jewish groups on and off campus have denounced the report as flawed, saying it missed the significance of an anti-Semitic text circulated online before Noah Lew was removed from the board last fall.\nA joint statement from five campus Jewish groups says the report, released this week by principal Suzanne Fortier, “appears to condone discrimination against Jewish students at McGill based on the cultural and religious organizations they affiliate with.”\nThe controversy has its roots in McGill’s long-running debate over the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.\nAt an Oct. 23 general assembly of the Student Society of McGill University, a routine motion to elect a slate of directors turned contentious.\nSupporters of a group called Democratize SSMU, formed to fight a decision of the board of directors declaring BDS counter to the SSMU constitution, brought a motion to divide the election vote.\nIn the past they had been ratified as a bloc.\nThe first five candidates were overwhelmingly approved, but when they got to Lew, the only Jewish director, he was rejected 105 to 73.\nIn a subsequent Facebook post, Lew wrote, “My Jewish identity was now public, and a target was placed squarely upon me by the McGill BDS movement.”\nAn outcry followed, leading Fortier to appoint former Ombudsperson for Students, Spencer Boudreau, to investigate.\nShe also created a Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life and a support line to report incidents of intolerance.\nBoudreau interviewed 38 students over his three-and-a-half week investigation.\nHis findings, he wrote, do “not substantiate the notion that the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism,” which he defined as hostility toward or discrimination against Jews.\nRather, he found, votes against Lew were “motivated by politics, that is, based on his support for Israel and Zionism and\/or for his view of the BDS movement.” Protests about Israel’s policies cannot be equated with anti-Semitism, Boudreau wrote, though he said Lew’s belief that he was targeted because he was Jewish was “honest and even understandable.”\nA statement Wednesday by Hillel McGill, Chabad at McGill and three other Jewish groups said Boudreau was mistaken about the timing of an anti-Semitic message posted online by Democratize SSMU.\nBoudreau’s report said the message followed the assembly vote, but in fact it was posted at the beginning of October.\nDemocratize SSMU deleted the message, which targeted Lew and two other candidates, after the meeting and apologized for publishing material that was “insensitive to anti-Semitic tropes of Jewish people as corrupt and politically powerful.”\nThe Jewish groups said this anti-Semitic rhetoric “was used to encourage students to vote specifically against Noah Lew.\nIt is under this context that the (general assembly) occurred, and the report fundamentally misunderstands this, which alters the entire findings of the report.”\nThey say Boudreau’s report “insinuates that Jewish students who engage with mainstream Jewish community organizations are permitted to be precluded from holding political office.”\nLew was restored to his post as a director last month after a ruling that the split vote in October had violated the SSMU constitution.\nHe was not immediately available for comment.\nMichael Mostyn, CEO of B’nai Brith Canada, called the report a whitewash.\n“The report does not present a full or accurate picture of the hostile atmosphere facing Jewish students at McGill,” he said in a statement.\nFortier said the university’s next actions will be based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life, due to report in April.\n“I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that there is absolutely no place for anti-Semitism at McGill University and that, as principal and vice-chancellor, I will remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe, welcomed and respected on our campuses,” she said in a statement.\n• Email: ghamilton@nationalpost.com | Twitter: grayhamilton\n>","completion":" Doubt|303|504\nLoaded_Language|1489|1525\nCausal_Oversimplification|1450|1552\nLoaded_Language|1555|1564\nName_Calling,Labeling|2878|2914\nDoubt|2953|3233\nExaggeration,Minimisation|4046|4083\nLoaded_Language|1303|1326\nName_Calling,Labeling|3659|3670."}
{"prompt":"Iranian Aggression Intensifies\n\nLast July, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) military commander and chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, warned that “putting the Revolutionary Guard in the terrorist lists with terrorist groups can be very costly to the United States and its military bases and forces in the region.” IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on October 8th that \"if the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.\"\nThe next day the Iranian regime warned of a \"crushing\" response if the United States were to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization.\nPresident Trump has called the Iranian regime’s bluff with his announcement last week that he would do just that.\nDesignating the IRGC as a terrorist organization and imposing new sanctions for its aggressive actions in the region is not a restoration of the sanctions lifted by the Obama administration as part of its disastrous nuclear deal with Iran.\nIf Iran insists it can do what it wants militarily in terms of missile launches, support of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, and arms transfers without violating the nuclear deal, then the United States can certainly act to curb such activities through financial pressure.\nThe U.S. can impose sanctions against the Iranian regime’s principal instrument for projecting aggressive, destabilizing force outside of its borders without violating the nuclear deal.\nThe Iranian regime does not see it that way, however.\nWith the lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions making available billions of dollars to Iran’s leaders to further finance the IRGC’s exploits in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, the regime is furious that the Trump administration is tightening the financial screws again, even if for reasons not directly related to Iran’s compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.\nThus, it is threatening U.S. forces and bases in the region.\nA couple of seemingly unrelated events this past week point to Iran’s positioning itself for more aggressive military actions that could place U.S. forces in harm’s way.\nOn Tuesday, Major General Bagheri landed in Damascus for talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad and senior Syrian officials, including the defense minister and the chief of staff of the Syrian armed forces.\nBagheri is quoted as saying that his visit’s purpose was to “put a joint strategy on continuing co-ordination and co-operation at the military level.” Some experts on Iran believe that Bagheri’s visit to Damascus at this time is intended to reinforce a message that Iran will continue to supply weaponry to Syria and to reinforce the presence of its terrorist proxy Hezbollah in Syria.\nThis will not only serve to bolster the Assad regime, but it also will strengthen Iran's ability to follow through on its threats to the U.S. and its allies, principally Israel.\nMeanwhile, following the departure of the Kurds from Kirkuk, Iraq earlier this week, the IRGC’s operational Al Qods arm reportedly established a command center and five bases there.\nAccording to Debkafile, this constitutes “the first military facility Iran has ever established openly in Iraq.” The Kirkuk region holds 45 percent of Iraqi’s oil.\nThe Iraqi branch of Iran’s terrorist proxy Hezbollah has vowed that once ISIS is defeated it will start killing Americans, as it has done before.\nIt is against this backdrop that U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley used her entire speech to the UN Security Council on Wednesday to denounce the Iranian regime on multiple grounds.\nThe session was supposed to be devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Ambassador Haley departed from the monthly ritual during which Israel is normally singled out for criticism by other Council members.\nShe went after Iran instead.\nShe explained why the Trump administration decided to take “a comprehensive approach to confronting the Iranian regime,” which does not give the regime a get out of jail free card even if it is in technical compliance with the loophole-ridden nuclear deal agreed to by the Obama administration.\n“We can’t talk about stability in the Middle East without talking about Iran,” Ambassador Haley said.\n“That’s because nearly every threat to peace and security in the Middle East is connected to Iran’s outlaw behavior.\nThe United States has now embarked on a course that attempts to address all aspects of Iran’s destructive conduct, not just one aspect.\nIt’s critical that the international community do the same.\nJudging Iran by the narrow confines of the nuclear deal misses the true nature of the threat.\nIran must be judged in totality of its aggressive, destabilizing, and unlawful behavior.\nTo do otherwise would be foolish.”\nAmbassador Haley accused the Iranian regime of continuing to “play” the Security Council.\n“Iran hides behind its assertion of technical compliance with the nuclear deal while it brazenly violates the other limits on its behavior.\nAnd we have allowed them to get away with it.\nThis must stop.”\nAmbassador Haley proceeded to list various violations by the Iranian regime of Security Council resolutions pertaining to the transfer of conventional weapons from Iran and the arming of terrorist groups, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah.\nShe also pointed to what she called the Iranian regime’s “most threatening act” – its launch of ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons.\n“When a rogue regime starts down the path of ballistic missiles, it tells us that we will soon have another North Korea on our hands,” Ambassador Haley said.\n“If it is wrong for North Korea to do this, why doesn’t that same mentality apply to Iran?\n“\nAs for the Iran’s supposed technical compliance with its commitments under the nuclear deal itself, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the UN’s international inspectors are not able to visit Iran’s military sites.\nPast work on nuclear explosive trigger devices appears to have taken place at one or more such sites in the past.\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Yukiya Amano admitted last month that when it comes to the IAEA’s capacity to check whether Iran was conducting work on a nuclear explosive device, his agency’s “tools are limited.” The Iranian regime has also attempted to skirt the restrictions in the JCPOA on its procurement of materials, equipment, goods and technology related to Iran’s nuclear activities.\nThe Heritage Foundation noted in its recent report on the JCPOA, for example, that Iran was “caught red-handed trying to purchase nuclear technology and restricted ballistic missile technology from German companies.”\nU.S. intelligence had discovered North Korea’s transfer of missile parts to Iran at the very same time that Iran was negotiating the nuclear deal, in clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions then in effect.\nThe Obama administration chose to look the other way.\nDoes anybody with a modicum of sense really believe that such collaboration between the two rogue nations is not going on today?\nIran is flush with cash, thanks to the JCPOA.\nIt wants to build out its missile and nuclear enrichment capabilities.\nIn addition to covert transfers of materials and technology to Iran in violation of the nuclear deal, the JCPOA may provide a loophole for Iran to exploit in outsourcing some of the development work to North Korea for hard currency, which North Korea desperately needs.\nThey are a perfect match for each other.\nProponents of the JCPOA argue that exiting the nuclear deal unless it is changed to the Trump administration’s satisfaction would undermine U.S. credibility with North Korea and thereby kill any chance of negotiations to resolve the crisis caused by North Korea's continued testing of sophisticated nuclear arms and ballistic missiles.\n\"If we want to talk to North Korea now, the possible end for the nuclear deal with Iran would jeopardize the credibility of such treaties,\" Reuters quoted German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel as saying.\nGermany is one of the parties to the JCPOA.\nOther European allies have voiced similar concerns.\nSo have Obama’s former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.\nThis argument is absurd on its face.\nThe whole point is to prevent Iran from becoming the next North Korea, not to kick the can down the road as usual.\nNorth Korea’s aggressive pursuit of nuclear weapons and of intercontinental ballistic missiles equipped with nuclear warheads proves that weak agreements full of front-loaded goodies rewarding rogue regimes for elusive promises are worthless.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried\n\nIn what is being considered a particularly rare event, scientists are projecting that the Sun will be an unusually cool customer by the year 2050.\nBy combining data and observations from decades of Sun research, experts are predicting a “Grand Solar Minimum” will occur a few decades from now, making our parent star dimmer and cooler than it has been for a very long time.\nThe Sun might look the same to you today as it has since the first time you laid eyes on it, but our star actually displays plenty of changes.\nThe Sun goes through regular cycles of solar minimums and solar maximums, which are periods where the Sun is either quite calm (the minimum) or incredibly active (the maximum).\nThese patterns repeat every 11 years or so, but new research suggests that there’s a pattern behind the pattern, and that a particularly cool solar minimum is on the way.\nThe study, which was published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, was carried out by a team led by physicist Dan Lubin of the University of California, San Diego.\nAfter combing the data, Lubin’s team has forecasted a grand minimum that will be around seven percent cooler than the typical solar minimum, making it a particularly calm moment for our star.\nDuring a solar minimum, the Sun produces far fewer solar flares and sunspots, and as a result, much less ultraviolet radiation is shot out into space and towards Earth.\nThis can have a number of effects on our planet, including changes in the thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer and temperatures far above ground.\nThose changes can affect weather, though forecasting specific differences has proven difficult.\nThe grand minimum will be an exaggerated version of the typical solar minimum, and could produce some very noticeable effects.\nThe most recent grand minimum is thought to have occurred back in the mid 1600s.\nThe event, called the Maunder Minimum, is credited with plunging temperatures to the point where the Thames River and Baltic Sea froze over.\nHowever, other parts of the planet heated up, including Alaska and Greenland, to far above their normal highs.\nThis temporary shakeup of temperatures could happen again, though the researchers say it will have very little effect on the overall global warming trend that mankind has created for itself.\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_Authority|2235|2354\nThought-terminating_Cliches|38|67."}
{"prompt":"Ex-Navy sailor pardoned by Trump says he's suing Comey and Obama\n\nA former Navy sailor who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials, alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law.\nSpecifically, Kristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, argues that the same officials who meted out punishment to him for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and handling of classified information.\nHis lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others.\n“They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,” Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, “but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton.\nHillary is still walking free.\nTwo guys on my ship did the same thing and weren’t treated as criminals.\nWe want them to correct the wrong.”\nDaigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December.\nThere is usually a six-month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed.\n“We’ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted,” Daigle said.\n“We’re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there’s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.”\nWhile campaigning, and after taking office, Trump frequently voiced support for Saucier, who in March became the second person he pardoned.\nTrump often compared the Obama administration’s handling of Saucier’s case with that of Clinton.\nSaucier, who lives in Vermont, pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009.\nHe said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine's propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera.\nSaucier said that he recognized he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked.\nBut he lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton's emails.\n“My case was usually something handled by military courts,” he said.\n“They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton.”\nSaucier, 31, said that the pardon has enabled him to pick up the pieces and rebuild his life with his wife and young daughter.\nA felony conviction left him scrambling to find work; he finally landed a job collecting garbage.\nNow, he works on design and engineering projects for an industrial boiler company.\n“Things are starting to go in the right direction,” Saucier said.\n“I work with a group of really great people, I get to use my skills set.”\nBecause of the loss of income during his imprisonment, as well as earning below his potential when he collected garbage, he and his wife Sadie lost their home to foreclosure.\nDebt collectors called and his cars were repossessed.\n“With a pardon there’s no magic wand that that gets waved and makes everything right,” he said, “But I try to stay positive and look forward.”\nHe praises the pardons that Trump has granted, and takes exception at the criticism.\n“The Obama administration singled out Dinesh for things most people don’t even get charged for,” Saucier said.\n“President Trump noticed that my career was exemplary and that I didn’t deserve what happened to me.\nConservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who was pardoned by Trump last week, had pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud.\nTrump tweeted Thursday: \"Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D'Souza today.\nHe was treated very unfairly by our government!\"\nD'Souza was sentenced in 2014 to five years of probation after he pleaded guilty to violating federal election law by making illegal contributions to a U.S. Senate campaign in the names of others.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n>","completion":" Causal_Oversimplification|2749|2825\nFlag-Waving|4178|4192."}

Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the number of cases has risen by 50%, and The World Health Organization has now said it is preparing for “the worst case scenario.”\nThe WHO has tallied 32 suspected or confirmed cases in the northwestern area of Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumbathe near the border with the Republic of Congo, including 18 deaths, between April 4 and May 9.\nThe outbreak, declared by the DRC health ministry on Tuesday, is the DRC’s ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976,when the deadly viral disease was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team.\nScientists are greatly concerned that this outbreak in the remote Bikoro region will travel 175 miles to the city of Mbandaka – the capital of Equateur province and home to around 1.2 million residents.\nWe’ve updated this map.\nTurns out that the provincial capital of Equateur, Mbandaka, is home to roughly 1M people.\nIt’s less than 300 km or 175 miles from Bikoro and reachable by water.\npic.twitter.com\/3Q3PwAAdsh — Helen Branswell (@HelenBranswell) May 11, 2018\nWhat’s worrisome is that the most recent WHO update says that there are two probable cases at Wangata – which is very close to Mbandaka.\n#EbolaDRC: This news gives me pause.\n@WHO‘s latest update says there are 2 probable cases at Wangata, which is adjacent to the provincial capital, Mbandaka.\nPopulation of

Organization (WHO) said last week: “If we see a town of that size infected with Ebola, then we are going to have a major urban outbreak,” adding “We are very concerned, and we are planning for all scenarios, including the worst-case scenario.”\nToday I had the chance to see first-hand the #Ebola response in #DRC.\nTeams are motivated and working hard.\nI visited the hospital in Bikoro where

similar to the one set up by the WHO.\nThe WHO and World Food Programme are also working to set up an ‘air-bridge’ to help bring in supplies, however, only helicopters can be used until an airfield is cleared to allow larger planes to land, Mr Salama added.\nThe health body has released £738,000 ($1m) from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to support response activities for the next three

infected out of which 49 died – a 74% fatality rate.\nIn the 2002-2003 outbreak, 90% of those infected died.\nThat said, on average the disease kills around half of those who contract it.\nEbola, a haemorrhagic fever, killed at least 11,000 across the world after it decimated West Africa and spread rapidly over the space of two years.\nThe pandemic was officially declared over back in January 2016, when Liberia was announced to be Ebola-free by the WHO.\nThe country, rocked by back-to-back civil wars that ended in 2003, was hit the hardest by the fever, with 40 per cent of the deaths having occurred there.\nSierra Leone reported the highest number of Ebola cases, with nearly of all those infected having been residents of the nation.\n-Daily Mail\nExperts say the DRC’s vast, remote terrain provides an advantage, as outbreaks often remain localized and easy to isolate.\nBikoro, however, is not far from the Congo river – an essential waterway used for transport and commerce.\nDownstream lies Kinshasa and Brazzaville – the DRC’s capital.\nThe two cities are home to a combined 12 million people.\nAs such, neighboring countries are on high alert.\nOfficials in Nigeria, Guinea and Gambia have incresaed screening measures along their airports and borders, measures which helped contain the virus during the West African epidemic that began in 2013.\nAngola, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Rwanda, Burundi and the Republic of Congo – which border the DRC – have all been alerted.\nWhile Kenya, which does not border the country, has issued warnings over the possible spread of Ebola.\nThermal guns to detect anyone with a fever have been put in place along its border with Uganda and at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.\nConcerned health officials in Nigeria, which also does not border the DRC, have put similar measures in place to keep its population safe.\n-Daily Mail\nScientists believe Ebola is most often passed to humans by fruit bats, however porcupines, gorillas, antelope and chimpanzees could also be carriers.\nIt is transmitted between humans through blood, secretions and other bodily fluids (and surfaces) of those infected.\nThere is currently no “proven” treatment for Ebola, however dozens of experimental drugs exist – including a vaccine called rVSV-ZEBOV, which has reportedly protected nearly 6,000 people.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|3936|3945."}
{"prompt":"Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’\n\nOutside of specialists and seekers, the only reason why there is general interest in the Qur’an among non-Muslims is to seek an answer to the question of whether or not it justifies and encourages Islamic terrorism.\nWith What the Qur’an Meant: And Why It Matters, religion author Garry Wills is here to reassure us:\nWhat did the scripture of Islam tell me about the duty to kill infidels?\nSome people are sure it is there, though it isn’t.\nThen what does it say about Shari’ah law?\nNot a thing (p. 7).\nThat would be good to know, were Wills a reliable witness.\nUnfortunately, he proves to be just the opposite: Wills laments “Robert Spencer of Jihad Watch calling for a ban on the Qur’an” (p. 58).\nI have never called for such a ban, and oppose in principle the banning of any book.\nWills, not surprisingly, does not offer any quotation from me to back up his false claim.\nHis manifest unreliability on this point casts a shadow on his primary assertions about the Qur’an.\nWills seems determined to put the best possible face on the Qur’an, which requires him to ignore a great deal of Qur’anic incitement and hatred.\nFor example, he quotes 5:51 -- “You who believe, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies” (p. 114) -- but he nonetheless concludes, after ten pages of tu quoque arguments and other legerdemain, that “the Qur’an is fraternal in its treatment of other faiths” (p. 124).\nWills never mentions Qur’an 9:29, which commands Muslims to wage war against Jews and Christians and subjugate them as inferiors under the rule of Sharia.\nWills is no more trustworthy when he deals with the question of violence in the Qur’an.\nHe renders one key passage in this way: “Fight then until there is no more persecution, and worship [at the shrine] is devoted to God” (2:193; p. 133).\nWhence the bracketed interpolation “at the shrine”?\nWills doesn’t give any source for it; apparently it comes from none other than Garry Wills himself.\nBy adding “at the shrine” to this verse, Wills restricts the call to fight to the area around the Sacred Mosque in Mecca.\nHe ignores the fact that some Islamic authorities see this passage as calling for nothing less than unlimited warfare against non-Muslims.\nThe prominent Twentieth Century Indian Islamic scholar Muhammad Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri explains the passage this way:\nThe worst of sins are Infidelity ( Kufr) and Polytheism ( shirk) which constitute rebellion against Allah, The Creator.\nTo eradicate these, Muslims are required to wage war until there exists none of it in the world, and the only religion is that of Allah.\nWills doesn’t mention the existence of such interpretations, even to dismiss them.\nLikewise, when he claims that the Qur’an has “not a thing” to say about Sharia, he appears unaware that the Qur’an is one of the sources of Sharia.\nThe Qur’an’s declarations that a woman’s testimony is worth half that of a man’s (2:282), that a daughter is to receive a smaller part of an inheritance than a son receives (4:11), that thieves are to have their hands amputated (5:38), and that those who “wage war against Allah and his messenger” are to be crucified or have a hand and foot amputated on opposite sides (5:33) are part of Sharia in all its various expressions.\nBecause these stipulations are found in the Qur’an, they cannot be questioned or set aside.\nThroughout his book, Wills’ assurances that the Qur’an is not really as bad as “right-wing Islamophobes” say, or that the Bible contains material that is just as bad or worse, dissolve under close scrutiny.\nAgain and again it turns out that Wills has ignored key passages in order to make his case.\nHe asks why the Qur’an is “so ferocious to ‘hypocrites’ and apostates” (p. 124).\nThen he offers a quotation from the New Testament Letter to the Hebrews saying that “if we sin again on purpose” there is “only a terrifying judgment to come” (p. 126).\nWills concludes: “The Qur’an is not as absolute as this, because it always leaves room for God’s inexhaustible mercy and forgiveness” (p. 126).\nThat sounds wonderful, and certainly pleasing to multicultural ears to learn that the Qur’an is more merciful than the New Testament.\nUntil one realizes that, in his discussion of apostasy in the Qur’an, Wills has omitted all mention of the primary Qur’anic passage on this topic:\ntake our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\n* Dianne Feinstein Maxine Waters Adam Schiff Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand Keith Ellison Cory Booker\nEmail *\nEmail This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nThey wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike.\nSo do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah.\nBut if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper (4:89).\nTo “emigrate in the cause of Allah” is to leave one’s home and join up with the Muslims.\nThis passage envisions some of the disbelievers becoming Muslim, and then turning away again, whereupon the Muslims are told to “kill them wherever you find them.” God’s inexhaustible mercy, indeed.\nWills’ peaceful fantasy Qur’an raises one massive question that the author does not and cannot answer: if the Islamic holy book is really as peaceful and benign as Garry Wills makes it out to be, why do so very many Muslims worldwide misunderstand it?\nThe Islamic State (ISIS), in its heyday, quoted the Qur’an frequently -- odd behavior if the group actually was ignorant of, indifferent to, or in violation of the book’s core tenets.\nISIS quoted the Qur’an extensively in threats to blow up the White House and conquer Rome and Spain; in explaining its priorities in the nations it is targeting in jihad; in preaching to Christians after collecting the jizya (a Qur’an-based tax, cf.\nQur’an 9:29); in justifying the execution of accused spies; and in its various videos.\nISIS also awarded $10,000 prizes and sex slaves in Qur’an memorization contests.\nOne of its underground lairs was found littered with weapons and copies of the Qur’an.\nChildren in the Islamic State study the Qur’an and get weapons training.\nOne Malaysian Muslim said that the Qur’an led him to join the Islamic State.\nA Muslima in the U.S. promoted the Islamic State by quoting the Qur’an.\nAn Islamic State propagandist’s parents said of him: “Our son is a devout Muslim.\nHe had learnt the Quran by heart.” A Muslim politician from Jordan said that the Islamic State’s “doctrine stems from the Qur’an and Sunnah.”\nHow would Garry Wills explain all that?\nHe can’t;

they’re just factual.\nOnce again the media are blaming the messenger instead of dealing with Islamic violence.\nTrump didn’t add any rhetoric to his tweets.\nHe retweeted authentic videos.\n(The Dutch media now claim that one of them doesn’t depict Muslim migrants being violent, as was claimed.\nEven if this is true, Muslim migrant violence is a grim and increasingly common reality in Europe.)\nIf Muslims sincerely condemn jihad terror and sharia oppression, they shouldn’t oppose him.\nIn a letter to May, Bryant wrote: “I am writing to you to ask you and the home secretary to take immediate action to ban the president of the United States, Donald Trump, from entering the United Kingdom, due to his apparent support for far-right groups in this country.\nIn retweeting Jayda Fransen’s posts, it is absolutely clear to me that President Trump is supporting and condoning fascism and far-right activity.\nThis activity has frequently taken the form of violence on our streets.\nMs Fransen herself has a long history of racism and Islamophobia, some of it criminal.\nMany of the people you have rightly banned from entering the UK were guilty of less than this.”\n“Fascism.” By that Bryant means “defending British values.”\nWhile admitting numerous jihad preachers, Britain is keeping out the voices of sanity that would call that nation back to a path that would secure freedom for her children and her children’s children instead of a path to national suicide.\nAnd now a call to ban the president of the nation that saved their nation from extinction not 70 years ago.\nThe full story of my being banned from the UK for standing against jihad, and much more, is in my new book, FATWA: Hunted in America .\nGet the book.\nBuy it for friends.\nEducate those around you.\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller\n>","completion":" Doubt|1822|1871\nDoubt|1872|1943\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|2918|3005\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|293|373\nLoaded_Language|494|557\nLoaded_Language|566|630\nLoaded_Language|757|769\nLoaded_Language|982|1032\nCausal_Oversimplification|2543|2676\nLoaded_Language|3240|3276\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|3289|3379\nFlag-Waving|4087|4113\nLoaded_Language|4179|4199\nFlag-Waving|4211|4351."}
{"prompt":"Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist\n\nPope Paul VI’s 1965 encyclical on the Eucharist, “Mysterium Fidei,” was the first place I saw anyone say that the body and blood, soul and complete divinity of Christ was actually present in the consecrated species.\nHaving been raised in Remi de Roo’s Victoria in the 1970s, I had naturally never heard anything at all about the Eucharist.\nThe understanding that Catholics believed what they believe about it came as a bit of a shock.\n(Read the full document here. )\nWith the hindsight of 52 years and a great deal of very dirty and unappealing water under the Catholic bridge, we can see it as a kind of warning prophecy.\nPublished just three months before the close of Vatican II and just as Annibale Bugnini was cranking open the floodgates of his never-ending stream of liturgical alterations, Mysterium Fidei is now an important marker of a critical turning point in Catholic history, perhaps the most important of modern times.\n\nWho can read this without cringing at what we now know was about to happen:\nTherefore, we earnestly hope that the restored sacred liturgy will bring forth abundant fruits of eucharistic devotion, so that the Holy Church, under this saving sign of piety, may make daily progress toward perfect unity and may invite all Christians to a unity of faith and of love, drawing them gently, thanks to the action of divine grace.\nBut in 1983 at the start of my personal investigations into the Catholic religion, I knew nothing of any of that.\nThe encyclical, the very first I ever read, was also a marker for me of a personal turning point.\nIt was the first time I had ever seen Catholic eucharistic doctrine clearly and – most importantly – unapologetically stated.\nIt came right out and said something so astounding, something so completely unlikely, that I had to admit that it left very few logical possibilities.\nLike C.S.\nLewis’s assessment of the claims by Christ of His own divinity, this pope was either mad, bad or telling the plain truth.\n\nSomething that may be much more noteworthy now in our current circumstances than it was the year I read it, is that the pope’s very first quote was not of scripture, but the Council of Trent:\n“At the Last Supper, on the night He was handed over, Our Lord instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice of His Body and Blood, to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until He should come, and thus entrust to the Church, His beloved spouse, the memorial of His death and resurrection: a sacrament of devotion, a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a paschal banquet in which Christ is received, the soul is filled with grace and there is given to us the pledge of future glory.”\n\nIn these words are highlighted both the sacrifice, which pertains to the essence of the Mass which is celebrated daily, and the sacrament in which the faithful participate in Holy Communion by eating the Flesh of Christ and drinking His Blood, receiving both grace, the beginning of eternal life, and the medicine of immortality.\nI remember my thoughts upon reading this shocking statement… “By doing what?\n!”\n\nMy acceptance from the reading of this document of the Church’s orthodox eucharistic doctrine was based in part on Pope Paul’s gracious and beautiful exposition, and in part on the sheer radical, mad unlikeliness of it.\nWhat could conceivably be the reason to say anything as wild as this if it weren’t true?\n\nThe idea of transubstantiation struck me as I read that document as possibly the strangest and most earth shattering thing I’d ever heard.\nIt shocked me out of a kind of swamp of intellectual worldliness; presenting the idea to my thirsty mind that there could indeed be fantastic realities far more wonderful than the banal and painfully uninteresting secularist worldview I had been taught to accept.\nIt was as though someone had plausibly told me that, yes, there were fairies and magical kingdoms in real life, “just around the corner”.\n\nBy the time I read it, I had been through a long, slow transition from a childhood devoted to Our Lady and confirmed in my belief in wonders, to a kind of disappointed practical atheism after three years in a diocesan Catholic parochial school.\nI had been taught, by both word and implication, that everything the Catholic Church had taught before Vatican II was pernicious nonsense.\nWhere it was simply wrong it was ridiculous and where it was wrong and political it was outright wicked.\n\nWhat led me to read that particular encyclical is the most clearly identifiable moment of actual grace in my young life to that point.\nIt was the first time it occurred to me to investigate, like an anthropologist, what the Church herself said about her teachings.\nWhile mulling grimly one day over all the wickedness of the Catholic Church, I was pulled up short by a single thought: “I could be wrong.” At 17 it seemed such an unlikely thing to think I was rather shocked.\nBut stopping a moment to consider, I realised that I had only ever heard about Catholic things from people who clearly hated the Church; her enemies, in short.\nIt hardly seemed just to convict on the testimony of these obviously biased witnesses.\nIn order to properly and thoroughly condemn the Church, with convincing due diligence, I had to read something about it that didn’t come from her enemies.\n\nThe same day, I presented myself at the reference desk of the public library and asked, “Do you have any books about Catholicism?\nSomething official?” The librarian took me to the reference section and showed me the shelves of encyclicals, documents and histories.\nSaints and popes from one end of the stacks to the other.\nHaving no clear idea what my own question meant, I just picked one at random.\n\nThe description of the Holy Eucharist as the supreme Centre from which all our life as Catholics flow, and from which all other doctrines radiated, was something that was not going to come into my head for another eight years of reading.\nBut even so, Mysterium Fidei forced me to face up to a reality I’d never dreamed of before; that this, the little unassuming wafer, was the most important thing in the world.\n\nReading through the encyclical again, holding it up next to the current situation in Rome, makes it easier to clarify certain critical issues.\nGiven what we are now seeing, consider the poignancy of the following passages:\nWhen dealing with the restoration of the sacred liturgy, the Fathers of the council, by reason of their pastoral concern for the whole Church, considered it of the highest importance to exhort the faithful to participate actively with sound faith and with the utmost devotion in the celebration of this Most Holy Mystery, to offer it with the priest to God as a sacrifice for their own salvation and for that of the whole world, and to find in it spiritual nourishment.\nThis was, remember, 1965, four years before the New Mass was issued and before Cardinal Ottaviani warned the pope that it was precisely this sacramental reality that was about to be catastrophically obscured.\n\nWho, reading this passage, does not feel the urge to shout down the years, to do something to stave off the disaster that was coming:\n[W]e are aware of the fact that, among those who deal with this Most Holy Mystery in written or spoken word, there are some who with reference either to Masses which are celebrated in private, or to the dogma of transubstantiation, or to devotion to the Eucharist, spread abroad opinions which disturb the faithful and fill their minds with no little confusion about matters of faith.\nIt is as if everyone were permitted to consign to oblivion doctrine already defined by the Church, or else to interpret it in such a way as to weaken the genuine meaning of the words or the recognized force of the concepts involved.\nKeeping Cardinal Ottaviani’s Intervention directly before our thoughts, we read with a strange kind of helpless dread…\n…it is not allowable to emphasize what is called the “communal” Mass to the disparagement of Masses celebrated in private, or to exaggerate the element of sacramental sign as if the symbolism, which all certainly admit in the Eucharist, expresses fully and exhausts completely the mode of Christ’s presence in this sacrament.\n\nNor is it allowable to discuss the mystery of transubstantiation without mentioning what the Council of Trent stated about the marvelous conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the Body and of the whole substance of the wine into the Blood of Christ, speaking rather only of what is called “transignification” and “transfiguration,” or finally to propose and act upon the opinion according to which, in the Consecrated Hosts which remain after the celebration of the sacrifice of the Mass, Christ Our Lord is no longer present.\n[…]\n\nAnd therefore, so that the hope aroused by the council, that a flourishing of eucharistic piety which is now pervading the whole Church, be not frustrated by this spread of false opinions, we have with apostolic authority decided to address you, venerable brothers, and to express our mind on this subject.\n[1]\nThose of us writing similar jeremiads now have been working to clarify that the attack from Rome on the moral doctrine of the Church isn’t about marriage.\nIt’s about the Eucharist and to a lesser extent the priesthood.\nThe demonic forces we know are the driving force behind this supreme moment of heresy and destruction aren’t really looking at the undermining of marriage as their primary goal; they want to get at the Eucharist.\nWe know it is demonically inspired because their hatred is for Christ Himself in the first place and for anyone who loves and wants to serve Him second.\nThey are men who refuse to bend the knee before the God whom they will not serve.\n\nThis knowledge – that the attack is on the Body and Blood of Christ – can also help readers spot their friends in the crowd.\nThe places where Eucharistic adoration is still offered are places where at least some flicker of the true Faith survives.\nThe bishops and priests now talking about the supreme glory of the Eucharist, and the need to defend it from sacrilege, are lighthouses.\nA case in point is Bishop Mark Davies, of my own former diocese of Shrewsbury in England.\nIn March, 2016, in the midst of the shouting from Rome, Bishop Davies spoke at his Chrism Mass said that only through the “reality of the Eucharist” could new vocations to the priesthood be found.\n“In treasuring this gift of priestly celibacy we need to recognize more clearly the intimate link between the Ministerial Priesthood and the reality of the Eucharist.\nIf the Mass were ever reduced in our minds to being merely a commemorative meal and the priest as only a community leader or functionary, then the celibacy of the Catholic Priesthood might seem extravagant.”\nIt’s almost as if someone had slipped a copy of the Ottaviani Intervention inside his morning paper.\n\nThe targeting of marriage, through the instruments of creatures like the myopic and theologically tunnel-visioned Cardinal Kasper, is demonically brilliant.\nIt’s a “stitch-up” as the English call it; a fix.\nYou make it a matter of “mercy” (backed up by the iron fist) that no one in a state of objective mortal sin can be refused Holy Communion; you give the national bishops conferences the power to start enforcing this, and you have created a previously unimaginable situation in the Church.\nYou have created a regime in which a refusal to desecrate the sacred species will be grounds for persecution of faithful priests, seminarians and laity.\nAnd of course, we are seeing it starting already.\n\nIt’s a brilliant strategy, the magic bullet that will revert the Church to the 1976 model on every front, and very likely keep it there forever.\nAs if the goal was to go back in time and erase the entire John Paul II\/Benedict XVI period out of history.\nIt will halt the revival of eucharistic piety among seminarians; in fact, it will reverse the general reforming trend of “conservative” seminaries that was such a feature under John Paul II and has for 30 years been the hook upon which all hopes of restoration have hung.\n\nIt is easy to see what is coming next.\nOnce certain announcements are published in parish bulletins, laity will have to consider whether they can, in conscience, continue to assist at Masses where systematic sacrilege has been formally adopted as the rule.\nThe few bishops with sufficient spine to stand up to the pressure of both Rome and their own national conferences – newly empowered with directives to make doctrinal declarations – will be ruling embattled islands of Catholicism in a poisoned sea of systematic heresy and desecration.\nA dark, impenetrable and “irreversible” winter of persecution of the faithful by their own shepherds will fall.\n\nNot being a theologian I have no idea if this encyclical is, as so many of these seemingly orthodox documents of that period seem to be, rife with the usual “time bombs,” ambiguities, mushy language or even outright errors.\nI haven’t looked it up.\nI’m sure there are plenty of people out there qualified to examine it to see if it’s safe for Trad-Catholic consumption.\nAnd I have no doubt at all that there are better, more venerable, even more sublime and poignant works on the Eucharist in the canon of “official” things.\nFrom saints and Doctors of the Church and whatnot, many of which the pope cited.\nBut whatever its flaws, Mysterium Fidei is the one I found, and I’m convinced it wasn’t an accident.\n\nO God, in Your infinite mercy, forgive and have mercy on Pope Paul VI Montini for whatever neglect or damage of which he may have been guilty.\nIn this one case at least, a work of his was the exact right thing at the exact right time.\nFor me at least it was the key that opened the Door to Narnia.\n\n____________________\n\n\n[1] The fact that four years before the New Mass was issued, Paul VI was pinpointing in such detail exactly what Bugnini and co. were preparing makes it all but impossible to escape the conclusion that he knew perfectly well what was coming but approved the disastrous New Rite anyway.\nAnd then did nothing but weep as the inevitable disaster unfolded.\n>","completion":" Thought-terminating_Cliches|3987|4010\nLoaded_Language|603|661\nLoaded_Language|1020|1094\nLoaded_Language|3276|3379\nLoaded_Language|3471|4010\nLoaded_Language|4478|4500\nLoaded_Language|7026|7097\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|7971|8295\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|8298|8642\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|9586|9819\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|9373|9584\nLoaded_Language|11102|11126\nLoaded_Language|12634|12736\nThought-terminating_Cliches|13456|13555\nLoaded_Language|4376|4395\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|10661|10866\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|12738|12848."}
{"prompt":"Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?\n\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s outstanding performance at yesterday’s evidentiary hearing featuring attempted rape accuser Christine Blasey Ford may have revived his embattled nomination for the highest court in America.\nThe meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee showed the underhanded tactics employed by the Left against Judge Kavanaugh.\nThe nominee and Republican senators used the opportunity to attack desperate Democrats for their efforts at character assassination.\nPresident Trump was delighted.\n“Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him[,]” President Trump tweeted at 6:46 p.m. after the hearing wrapped up.\n“His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting.\nDemocrats’ search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist.\nThe Senate must vote!”\nFord, who claims Kavanaugh tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for several hours Thursday.\nKavanaugh testified separately after Ford’s testimony concluded.\nKavanaugh stole the show.\nThe judge forcefully stood up for himself as his voice trembled with righteous indignation, calling out Democratic senators for plotting against him.\nThe behavior of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment.\nBut at least it was just a good old-fashioned attempt at Borking.\nThose efforts didn't work.\nWhen I did at least okay enough at the hearings that it looked like I might actually get confirmed, a new tactic was needed.\nSome of you were lying in wait and had it ready.\nThis first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee, and by staff.\nIt would be needed only if you couldn't take me out on the merits.\nWhen it was needed, this allegation was unleashed and publicly deployed over Dr. Ford's wishes.\nAnd then, and then as no doubt was expected, if not planned, came a long series of false last-minute smears designed to scare me and drive me out of the process before any hearing occurred.\nAfraid of their own shadows, committee Republicans didn’t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to examine Ford.\nOpinions differ widely on how Mitchell performed.\nShe tiptoed around the alleged sexual assault itself, instead focusing on process-related questions, presumably in an effort to show undecided senators how Ford and her handlers have been unfairly manipulating the process.\nIn much of her testimony, Ford came across as presentable and seemingly credible, though vague and sometimes evasive, her ridiculous overall story notwithstanding.\nFord did well enough that during the break between her testimony and Kavanaugh’s, commentators on Fox News such as Brit Hume and Andrew Napolitano were openly musing about the nominee withdrawing, opinions that were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later.\nIt’s not that Mitchell did a bad job creating an inventory of the irregularities in the process and of the odd behavior of Ford and her lawyers.\nShe could do little else.\nShe had many restrictions placed upon her and was only allowed to question Ford for minutes at a time before surrendering the floor to the next committee Democrat.\nAs commentator Sean Davis tweeted:\n“Hard to do much else when the witness conveniently has no corroborating evidence, no memory of any verifiable facts of what happened, and everyone she says was present at the alleged incident--even her best friend--has denied it.”\nNonetheless, Mitchell’s questioning came across at times as perfunctory, leading many observers to conclude that Republicans threw away a valuable opportunity by using her as a stand-in.\nShe failed to lay a glove on a witness whose implausible, internally contradictory story cried out for vigorous cross-examination.\nIn the end the too-deferential, easygoing Mitchell failed to provide much, if anything, in the way of evidence against Ford or in favor of Kavanaugh.\nWhether her work will bring over fence-sitting senators to Kavanaugh’s side remains to be seen.\nLike other Democrats, Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii tried to help Ford, lobbing her softballs.\nAfter saying she thought she knew what Mitchell was trying to get at in her questions, the senator said, “so I'll just ask you very plainly, Dr. Ford, is there a political motivation for your coming forward with your account of the assault by Brett Kavanaugh?”\n“No, and I'd like to reiterate that again, I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of other what looked like equally-qualified candidates,” Ford replied.\nWhen Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Ford “with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?” Ford replied, “one hundred percent.”\nStrangely, Ford has a bad long-term memory and a bad short-term memory.\nShe doesn’t know when or where the alleged incident took place, yet she is “one hundred percent” certain it was Kavanaugh who attacked her.\nAt the outset of the hearing, Grassley provided an overview of what Kavanaugh had gone through –including the Democrats’ sordid behavior— since President Trump announced the judge’s nomination on July 9.\nAs part of the confirmation process, Kavanaugh endured his sixth background investigation since 1993.\n“Nowhere in any of these six FBI reports, which committee investigators have reviewed on a bipartisan basis, was there a whiff of any issue – any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior,” Grassley said.\nFord shared her allegations in a letter to the committee’s ranking member, Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), in the summer.\nThe letter remained secret from July 30 through until September 13 when he first learned about it, the chairman said.\nInstead of sharing the letter with the committee, Feinstein did nothing.\nBefore the hearing, Kavanaugh met privately with 65 senators, including Feinstein, who didn’t ask him about the allegations when she met with him in August.\nThe committee held a four-day public hearing from September 4 to September 7 during which Kavanaugh testified for more than 32 hours in public.\nFeinstein didn’t attend it, Grassley said.\nKavanaugh answered almost 1,300 written questions senators submitted after the hearing.\nThat is “more than all prior Supreme Court nominees,” he said.\n“Throughout this period, we did not know about the ranking member's secret evidence.\nThen, only at an 11th hour, on the eve of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation vote, did the ranking member refer the allegations to the FBI.\nAnd then, sadly, the allegations were leaked to the press.”\n“Every step of the way the Democratic side refused to participate in what should have been a bipartisan investigation,” Grassley said.\nAfter Ford’s identity became public, Grassley’s staff “contacted all the individuals she said attended the 1982 party described in the Washington Post article,” he said.\nKavanaugh “immediately submitted to an interview under penalty of felony for any knowingly false statements.\nHe denied the allegations categorically.”\n“Democratic staff was invited to participate and could have asked any questions they wanted to, but they declined.\nWhich leads me then to wonder: If they're really concerned with going to the truth, why wouldn't you want to talk to the accused?”\nGrassley said his staff contacted the other individuals who allegedly attended the party at which the conduct Ford complained of allegedly took place: Mark Judge, Patrick Smyth, and Leland Keyser.\n“All three submitted statements to the Senate under – under penalty of felony, denying any knowledge of the events described by Dr. Ford.\nDr. Ford's lifelong friend, Dr. – Miss Keyser, stated she doesn't know Judge Kavanaugh and doesn't recall ever attending a party with him.”\nGrassley said his staff repeatedly sought to interview Ford over the past 11 days, “even volunteering to fly to California to take her testimony, but her attorneys refused to prevent – present her allegations to Congress.”\n“Consistent with their stated desires to obstruct Kavanaugh's nomination” by any means possible, “pushed for FBI investigations into the allegations.”\n“We've been trying to investigate other allegations,” Grassley said.\n“At this time, we have not had cooperation from attorneys representing other clients, and they have made no attempt to substantiate their claims.”\nAttorneys for new Kavanaugh accusers Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick have been approached by committee staff on eight and six occasions, respectively, Grassley said.\n“Neither attorney has made their clients available for interview.\nThe committee can't do an investigation if attorneys are stonewalling.”\nWith his performance at the hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is frequently a target of conservatives for going rogue on important issues, partly redeemed himself in the eyes of many conservatives.\nWhile questioning Kavanaugh, Graham lambasted the confirmation process the judge has been put through, calling it “the most unethical sham since I've been in politics.”\nLashing out at Democrats, Graham said, “If you wanted an FBI investigation, you could have come to us.\nWhat you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020.”\n“Boy, you all want power,” he shouted.\n“God, I hope you never get it.\nI hope the American people can see through this sham.”\nGraham warned fellow GOPers about voting against the nomination.\n“To my Republican colleagues, if you vote no, you're legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics.\nYou want this seat?\nI hope you never get it.”\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) attacked Democrats, blaming them for the “circus atmosphere that has been created” since they first Ford's allegations to the media “two weeks ago, after sitting on them for six weeks.” This “has brought us the worst in our politics.”\n“It certainly has brought us no closer to the truth,” Hatch added.\n“Anonymous letters with no name and no return address are now being treated as national news.” Taking a shot at Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti, Hatch said “porn star lawyers with facially implausible claims are driving the news cycle.”\n“I hate to say this, but this is worse than Robert Bork, and I didn't think it could get any worse than that.\nThis is worse than Clarence Thomas.\nI didn't think it could get any worse than that.\nThis is a national disgrace, the way you're being treated.”\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on the nomination today at 9:30 a.m.\nAsked last night about the nomination moving to the floor of the Senate for a final vote, Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) reportedly answered, \"Depends on what happens tomorrow.\"\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is planning a procedural vote on Saturday to formally move to the nomination, followed by a potential confirmation vote by the full Senate as soon as Tuesday, Politico reports.\nA handful of Democrat senators, including the perpetually vulnerable red-state senator, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, are reportedly considering voting to confirm Kavanaugh when the nomination goes before the full Senate.\nIf Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.\nIt normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have been only eight justices.\nRoughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.\nDemocrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they hope to seize control from Republicans.\nElection Day is November 6.\nThe GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.\nThe confirmation drama continues.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|812|822\nLoaded_Language|2773|2797\nFlag-Waving|9516|9568\nLoaded_Language|9878|9895\nName_Calling,Labeling|10304|10321\nExaggeration,Minimisation|10409|10636\nFlag-Waving|10579|10636\nName_Calling,Labeling|11178|11218\nLoaded_Language|9213|9217\nRepetition|10562|10567\nSlogans|492|515\nName_Calling,Labeling|741|768\nLoaded_Language|1202|1237\nLoaded_Language|2043|2061\nName_Calling,Labeling|2231|2244\nDoubt|3473|3704\nLoaded_Language|3981|4021\nLoaded_Language|4339|4360\nDoubt|4977|5036\nLoaded_Language|8987|8998\nExaggeration,Minimisation|9194|9245\nCausal_Oversimplification|9351|9443\nLoaded_Language|9447|9470\nExaggeration,Minimisation|9702|9762\nLoaded_Language|9784|9807\nExaggeration,Minimisation|10043|10068\nDoubt|10304|10354\nAppeal_to_Authority|866|886\nLoaded_Language|1121|1145\nRepetition|1964|1972\nLoaded_Language|2144|2171\nDoubt|4513|4620\nRepetition|5626|5635\nDoubt|7400|7497\nLoaded_Language|8857|8869\nLoaded_Language|9564|9568\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|9666|9762."}

{"prompt":"The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh\n\nTwo more women accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh of dubious improprieties materialized out of thin air late Sunday, throwing Senate Republicans’ hope of finally confirming the Supreme Court nominee this week even more into doubt.\nThe new allegations came yesterday amid reports that Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tentatively scheduled a hearing for this Thursday to take testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, sexually assaulted her decades ago when he was a high school student.\nSuspiciously, Ford can’t –or won’t— say when or where the alleged incident happened and can provide few details.\nAs Paul Sperry writes at the New York Post, working with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and backed financially by George Soros’s money, Ford’s lawyers spent the last few days gaming the system.\nAfter stalling Grassley and getting repeated extensions, the attorneys got the chairman to cave on various demands, such as that Kavanaugh not be in the room when Ford gives evidence.\nRepublicans never seem to learn from their mistakes.\nAs usual, Republicans’ seeming reasonableness is rewarded with more abuse by the Left.\nGive left-wingers an inch and they’ll take a mile.\nDemocrats, it turns out, used the extra time created through their delaying tactics to produce two new women with questionable claims against Kavanaugh.\nMore accusers could be on their way.\nPresident Trump continues to support Kavanaugh, who maintains his innocence.\n“This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,” the nominee said Sunday of Ford’s accusations.\n“The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so.\nThis is a smear, plain and simple.\nI look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name — and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building — against these last-minute allegations.”\nIf Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench on October 1, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.\nThe high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have only been only eight justices in place.\nRoughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.\nDemocrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they stand a good chance of taking control from Republicans.\nElection Day is November 6.\nThe GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.\nMeanwhile, the New Yorker magazine reported Sunday that Deborah Ramirez, 53, suddenly claims to have been assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College.\nRamirez claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.\nAlso on Sunday, media-savvy sleazeball lawyer Michael Avenatti, who represents porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted that he represents another woman who plans to accuse Kavanaugh of something.\n“I represent a woman with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh and Mark Judge.\nWe will be demanding the opportunity to present testimony to the committee and will likewise be demanding that Judge and others be subpoenaed to testify,” Avenatti wrote on Twitter.\n“My client is not Deborah Ramirez.”\nWashington insiders still believe Kavanaugh will be confirmed, or at least they did before the two new accusers popped up.\nFor example, at a Friday afternoon preview of upcoming cases in the Supreme Court’s approaching October term that was hosted by the Federalist Society, panelist Thomas C. Goldstein of the law firm of Goldstein & Russell predicted that the high court would have nine members again soon.\n“There is exactly a zero percent chance that [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley will allow this thing to get past the lame-duck” congressional session after Election Day, said the co-founder of SCOTUSblog who has appeared before the Supreme Court many times.\n“I think we ought to recognize that.\nThe prospect that the Democrats will take the Senate, albeit thin, is realistic, and so they will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure that there is a ninth member of the court there by the time a Democratic majority could take over in the Senate in January.”\nWe’ll see soon enough if Goldstein’s prediction comes true.\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|4|21\nLoaded_Language|108|136\nDoubt|573|684\nLoaded_Language|863|880\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1206|1255\nName_Calling,Labeling|1211|1223\nLoaded_Language|1714|1719\nName_Calling,Labeling|2978|3007\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3878|3907\nLoaded_Language|4007|4020."}

Jackie Speier (D-CA) told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press Daily on Tuesday that the U.S. House of Representatives has paid $15 million to alleged victims of sexual harassment by its own members in recent years.\n“We do know there is about $15 million that has been paid out by the House on behalf of harassers in the last ten to 15 years,” she said.\n“15 million dollars has been paid out over sexual harassment claims,” Todd replied, somewhat shocked.\n“So, obviously more than one member of Congress.”\nIf members of Congress are engaged in this type of behavior, why don’t the American people know about it?\nAnd why are those members of Congress still allowed to serve?\nRepresentative Barbara Comstock also testified on Tuesday.\nShe said that one current member of Congress exposed his private parts to a female staffer when she delivered papers to his house…\nRep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) said at a House Administration Committee hearing on Tuesday that a sitting member of the U.S. Congress exposed himself to a young female staffer who delivered papers to his house–at his request.\nWe need to be told who this member of Congress is so that he can be removed from Congress immediately.\nThis kind of behavior is not acceptable for anyone in a civilized society – and that goes double for someone that is supposed to be one of the leaders of our nation.\nHere are the exact words that Comstock used as she described this incident…\nThis member asked a staffer to bring them over some materials, to their residence.\nAnd the young staffer — it was a young woman — went there and was greeted with a member in a towel.\nIt was a male, who then invited her in.\nAnd at that point, he decided to expose himself.\nShe left, and then she quit her job.\nShe left, she found another job.\nOf course, this sort of behavior is not just limited to members of Congress.\nAccording to an ex-Secret Service agent, Vice-President Joe Biden was regularly engaged in “Weinstein-level” predatory behavior…\nAn ex-Secret Service agent is claiming that former Vice President Joe Biden engaged in “Weinstein-level” sexual assault and that he would walk around the VP residence late at night completely naked.\nAccording to Big League Politics’ Cassandra Fairbanks, a Secret Service agent who spoke on condition of anonymity revealed that Biden “would mess with every single woman or teen,” and that a Christmas get-together at the VP’s house had to be canceled “because Biden would grope all of our wives and girlfriend’s asses.”\nIn fact, things were so bad that at one point a Secret Service agent almost got into a fight with Biden.\nHere is more from Paul Joseph Watson…\nDuring one alleged incident in 2009, Biden cupped the breast of a Secret Service agent’s girlfriend during a photo, prompting the agent to shove Biden and almost hit him.\nThe agent was subsequently suspended for a week, according to the source.\nMen would often stand in front of female agents and Navy women or create false pretenses to have them leave the room just to get them away from Biden, according to the agent.\nWhen I am elected to Congress, I am going to make fighting this sort of predatory behavior a top priority.\nWe are supposed to serve as an example to the rest of the world, and instead, we have become a bad joke.\nThose that have been engaging in this sort of shameful behavior have got to go because we simply are not going to put up with it anymore.\nArticle posted with permission from End of the American Dream\nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|563|579\nLoaded_Language|698|735\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1723|1819\nRepetition|4462|4493\nName_Calling,Labeling|4664|4699\nName_Calling,Labeling|4789|4820\nLoaded_Language|259|276\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|351|496\nName_Calling,Labeling|662|688\nLoaded_Language|1306|1337\nSlogans|1629|1656\nFlag-Waving|1657|1721\nLoaded_Language|2207|2240\nLoaded_Language|2249|2273\nLoaded_Language|2312|2360\nLoaded_Language|3497|3542\nFlag-Waving|3987|4075\nLoaded_Language|4882|4898\nExaggeration,Minimisation|5035|5079\nLoaded_Language|5166|5219\nExaggeration,Minimisation|5166|5219\nFlag-Waving|5890|5993\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|5995|6131\nFlag-Waving|614|735\nLoaded_Language|5983|5993."}

{"prompt":"Exposing the Deep State Plotters\n\nPresident Trump’s sweeping order this week directing intelligence agencies to declassify documents from the more than 18-month-old investigation related to the Left’s electoral collusion conspiracy theory involving Trump and Russia may shed light on what really happened in the 2016 election.\nIn an interview with Hill.TV yesterday, the president said he ordered the mass declassification to show the public that the FBI investigation of the conspiracy theory began as a “hoax.” Exposing it could be one of the “crowning achievements” of his presidency, he said.\n“What we’ve done is a great service to the country, really,” he said.\n“I hope to be able to call this, along with tax cuts and regulation and all the things I’ve done… in its own way this might be the most important thing because this was corrupt.”\nTrump criticized how the FBI handled the Russia probe, accusing it of misleading the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court, and of spying on his campaign.\n“They know this is one of the great scandals in the history of our country because basically what they did is, they used [former Trump campaign aide] Carter Page, who nobody even knew, who I feel very badly for, I think he’s been treated very badly.\nThey used Carter Page as a foil in order to surveil a candidate for the presidency of the United States.”\n“It’s a hoax, beyond a witch hunt,” Trump said.\nThe documents affected involve a FISA warrant against Carter Page and text messages from disgraced ex-FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.\n(Carter Page is not related to Lisa Page.)\nAlthough the conspiracy theory is baseless nonsense, it continues to dog the Trump administration, providing cable television news outlets and late-night talk show hosts with endless fodder in the 24-hour news cycle.\nWhen Trump defenders have fought back, social media companies have colluded with the Left to silence and intimidate them.\nThis declassification effort won’t make things any worse than they are for President Trump.\nIt may even prove a political masterstroke of sorts for Trump.\nHow else does one fight back against the nameless, faceless bureaucrats of the Deep State who hide behind anonymity to undermine the duly elected 45th president of the United States?\nMake the documents public and let the chips fall where they may.\nThere is so much leftist dirt to uncover.\nFor example, it was established some time ago that former President Obama was involved on some level in this shameful un-American plot to rig the 2016 election and undermine his successor by using the privacy-invading apparatus of the state.\nObama wanted “to know everything” the FBI was doing in its investigation into claims that Russia was interfering in the 2016 election.\nSpecifically, the statement that Obama wanted “to know everything we’re doing” came in a private Sept. 2, 2016, text message from FBI lawyer Lisa Page to FBI agent Peter Strzok, with whom she was having an extramarital affair at the time.\n(The exact message, time-stamped 1:50 p.m., reads \"Yes, bc potus wants to know everything we are doing.\")\nIn a separate text message to Page, Strzok wrote something cryptic about an “insurance policy” in case Donald Trump got elected.\nApparently, he was referring to the salacious, unverified dossier Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid rent-a-spy Christopher Steele to compile that purports to show Trump’s nefarious links to Russia.\nPresident Trump ordered that the relevant documents be released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department “[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency,” read a statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\nTrump ordered the “immediate declassification” of “pages 10-12 and 17-34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in the matter of Carter W. Page,” “all FBI reports of interviews with Bruce G. Ohr prepared in connection with the Russia investigation,” and “all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all Carter Page FISA applications.”\nTrump also ordered the “the Department of Justice (including the FBI) to publicly release all text messages relating to the Russia investigation, without redaction, of James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr.”\nThe chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Devin Nunes (R -Calif.), reportedly hailed Trump’s order, saying it covers “pretty much everything that he wanted … and the text messages are a bonus.”\nA handful of Democratic lawmakers alarmed at the prospect of being exposed as frauds and publicly humiliated wrote Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and FBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday.\nThe letter, which is an attempt to usurp the powers vested in the president, asks the three agencies to defy the presidential directive.\n\"Your agencies' review, and any communication with the White House on the substance of the material, should not proceed further until you have briefed the Gang of Eight in person.\"\nIt claims that Trump’s declassification request constitutes improper intervention “in an ongoing law enforcement investigation that may implicate the President himself or those around him.”\nThe authors of the letter even lie about the nature of the broad-based request, claiming Trump is selectively declassifying information to save himself.\n“The action he has taken, to direct your agencies to selectively disclose classified information that he believes he can manipulate publicly to undermine the legitimacy and credibility of the Special Counsel’s [Robert Mueller] investigation, is a brazen abuse of power.”\nThe missive is signed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who is vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who is ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\nIntelligence agencies have already reportedly begun working to carry out the president’s orders and the first set of documents could be made public in a few days.\n“When the President issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House Counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America’s national security interests,” a Justice Department official told Fox News.\n“The Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President’s order.”\nCoats spokeswoman Kellie Wade also said that the agency was “working expeditiously with our interagency partners to conduct a declassification review of the documents the President has identified for declassification.”\nAccording to Fox News:\nThe documents include all FBI reports on interviews, also known as 302s, with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with applications to surveil Carter Page, as well as 21 pages of one renewed warrant.\nThe 21 pages make up only a small portion of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in a heavily redacted format.\nThe June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year.\nIn comments to reporters and on Twitter, President Trump has been blasting Strzok and Page for months over their inappropriate behavior.\nDitto for former FBI Director James Comey and one of his deputies, Andrew McCabe.\nTrump fired Comey in May 2017 and Attorney General Jeff Sessions canned McCabe in March.\nPage left the FBI in May and Strzok got the axe last month.\nThat means there are still thousands of unaccountable Deep State operatives in the Trump administration that have yet to be dealt with.\n>","completion":" Exaggeration,Minimisation|1025|1088\nName_Calling,Labeling|2140|2188\nName_Calling,Labeling|5113|5130\nLoaded_Language|5731|5754\nLoaded_Language|7619|7636\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1780|1794\nName_Calling,Labeling|3326|3349\nDoubt|5333|5484\nName_Calling,Labeling|9|32\nName_Calling,Labeling|500|510\nLoaded_Language|534|586\nExaggeration,Minimisation|780|818\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1177|1197\nLoaded_Language|1269|1295\nName_Calling,Labeling|1371|1403\nName_Calling,Labeling|1507|1533\nLoaded_Language|1605|1702\nName_Calling,Labeling|1827|1842\nLoaded_Language|2048|2078\nName_Calling,Labeling|2228|2280\nLoaded_Language|2356|2376\nLoaded_Language|2498|2523\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|2944|3003\nLoaded_Language|3160|3177\nLoaded_Language|3402|3435\nLoaded_Language|2308|2345\nLoaded_Language|4460|4480\nLoaded_Language|4610|4684\nLoaded_Language|4846|4900\nLoaded_Language|4926|4960\nLoaded_Language|7906|7917\nLoaded_Language|7846|7852\nName_Calling,Labeling|7970|8005\nFlag-Waving|598|655\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1378|1403\nName_Calling,Labeling|1639|1656."}
{"prompt":"There Were “Active Shooters On The Runway” Bombshell Air Traffic Control Audio From The Night Of The Las Vegas Massacre Reveals\n\nIn yet another striking example of a widespread cover-up currently underway regarding the worst mass shooting in American history, new air traffic control audio has been released that details the fact that there were multiple active shooters on the airports property which is extremely close to the venue where at least part of the attack took place.\nThe audio recordings, taken from the night of the October 1st massacre that left 58 dead and over 500 injured, are further proof that multiple shooters were used throughout the area, a fact that directly contradicts the official story.\nDuring the air traffic control recordings, which were released by political strategist and co-founder of “The New Right” Mike Tokes, one of the dispatchers is heard telling an incoming plane that landing might not be a good idea because there were multiple active shooters on the airport property itself.\n“Shutting down might not be a good idea, there’s active shooters on the runway,” he declared.\n“The 19s are closed, we are in the process of trying to round them up, they are on the airport property.”\nAir traffic control tapes on the night of the Las Vegas shooting: “There’s active shooters on the runway.\nThey’re on the airport property” pic.twitter.com\/HZf3LBeAgk — Mike Tokes (@MikeTokes) October 29, 2017\nThis stunning tower audio once again provides proof that the entire narrative that claims that Stephen Paddock operated alone from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel is complete nonsense and that authorities are actually actively covering up what really happened on that fateful night.\nWhile there have been countless stories since the attack that raise the very real possibility that this was a false flag, one has stood out due to the fact that the person who released the information died shortly after.\nAs Shepard Ambellas reported in a now viral article, “Kymberley Suchomel, who posted her eyewitness account of the Las Vegas massacre in astonishingly vivid detail to her Facebook page on Oct. 4, subsequently passed away in her home on Oct. 9 from what reports are claiming are natural causes.”\n“Shockingly, just days before her death, Suchomel posted key details about the shooting to Facebook that contradicted the official narrative which claims that Stephen Paddock was the lone gunman.”\nFrom dozens of eyewitness reports, including Suchomel’s, that clearly indicate the presence of multiple shooters, to the possibility of helicopters being used in the attack, the American people are clearly not being told the truth.\nIt is also important to keep in mind that multiple investigative reports conducted by other alternative media outlets have actually named government officials and private companies that may be behind the attack and so far there has been no official denial from either.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|166|185\nDoubt|2609|2665\nLoaded_Language|1605|1622\nDoubt|1632|1698\nLoaded_Language|144|160\nLoaded_Language|1435|1455."}

{"prompt":"SO MUCH FOR MERCY & DIALOGUE: Member of Vatican International Theological Commission Sacked for Questioning Pope of Mercy & Dialogue\n\nThe Catholic Twitterverse is alive today with criticism of the USCCB’s decision to sack Fr.\nThomas Weinandy, the former head of their doctrinal office.\nIt took a matter of hours for the brave defenders of the status quo to leap into action against the mild Franciscan friar’s polite plea to Pope Francis to defend the Catholic Faith and faithful.\nOr at least to stop attacking them.\nIn a letter made public November 1st, Fr.\nWeinandy, a former chief of staff for the U.S. Bishops’ Committee on Doctrine and a member of the Vatican’s International Theological Commission, warned Pope Francis that he has caused “chronic confusion” among the faithful and bishops.\n\n\n\nHe wrote to the pope, “To teach with such an intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth.” He added that Catholics are “disconcerted” by the appointment of bishops “who seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief, but who support and even defend them.”\n\n\n\nIn an interview yesterday with John Allen’s Crux, he added, more prophetically than he had perhaps intended, “I don’t think anyone can, or should, associate my letter with the USCCB or the American bishops.\nNeither was involved in my writing the letter, and its publication will be news to them.”\n\n\n\n“Bishops are quick learners,” he wrote in his letter, “and what many have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it,” claiming that many bishops don’t speak out publicly for fear they will be “marginalized or worse.”\n\n\n\nAnd sure enough, within hours of making his letter public, we learned that Fr.\nWeinandy had been given the boot.\nOf course, the Twitterverse is busy commenting on the irony: how a man expressing grave concerns that there is an atmosphere of fear of being punished for expressing grave concerns, was immediately fired.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most astonishing aspect of this little incident is just how completely blind the US bishops – as with nearly all the episcopate – are to what political analysts call the “optics”.\nPolitical consultants often ask: how does it look?\nAnd it looks extremely bad.\nAs though the fog of irony weren’t thick enough, in response to the outrage from Catholics, the USCCB has done what all the other members of Pope Francis’ cabal have done and started blocking critics from its Twitter account.\nWhich, it must be said, only proves Fr.\nWeinandy’s point once again.\n\n\n\nSome of the criticism has been unusually sharp.\nFr.\nHunwicke wrote this afternoon, “This cheap and vulgar ritual humiliation exemplifies the extent to which P[ope] F[rancis] is presiding over a bully-boy Church in which midget bishops and minicardinals compete to defeat each other in the sycophancy stakes.\nJust as Tom Weinandy has, in effect, just said.”\n\n\n\nAs I write this, the outrage is doing the opposite of dying down, and is surely a sign of how fed up Catholics – even those who would never identify themselves as Traditionalists – have become with this pope and his cadre of episcopal bullies.\nIn his letter, Fr.\nWeinandy made a point of stating that he is not signatory to the Filial Correction or any other public declaration against Pope Francis’ agenda.\n\n\n\nIn fact, a former student of his wrote to me today saying,\n“I see that Fr.\nThomas Weinandy has been squashed.\nHe was one of my professors in Patristics at Oxford and he was one of the most mild-mannered, least confrontational, kindest academics one could have hoped to meet.\nTo me, the fact that he has chosen to write to express his concern about the crisis in the church and the papacy is very significant.\n\nHe is neither a traditionalist, nor a controversialist, but a humble and straightforward Friar who is clear-thinking and entirely loyal to the Church and Her teaching.\nI would be surprised now if we were not see more of this sort of letter\/exercise of conscience.\nI imagine that it’s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence.”\nWhen I posted it, this assessment was backed up by Joseph Shaw, the head of the UK’s Latin Mass Society and the spokesman for the Filial Correction, who wrote, “This is absolutely right.\nNot a man to seek out confrontation.”\n\nThe Crux piece offered a succinct bullet point list of Fr.\nWeinandy’s concerns.\nHe said the pope is…\nFostering “chronic confusion.”\n“Demeaning” the importance of doctrine.\nAppointing bishops who “scandalize” believers with dubious “teaching and pastoral practice.”\nGiving prelates who object the impression they’ll be “marginalized or worse” if they speak out.\nCausing faithful Catholics to “lose confidence in their supreme shepherd.”\nOur friend Edward Pentin has reproduced the full text of the letter at the National Catholic Register which is definitely worth a read.\nFr.\nWeinandy sent the letter to the pope on July 31, the Feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola.\nLike the Dubia cardinals, he said he made it public only after the pope had ignored it for months.\n\nNotable in his critique is its distinct pastoral flavour, his concern on the effect the situation is having on ordinary people.\nThe pope, he said, seems “to censor and even mock” critics of Amoris Laetitia for their desire to interpret it in keeping with Catholic teaching, and in doing so is committing a “kind of calumny…alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry.”\n\nIn an interview with Crux, Weinandy said he is not afraid of reprisals but “more concerned about the good that my letter might do.” The letter “expresses the concerns of many more people than just me, ordinary people who’ve come to me with their questions and apprehensions.\nI wanted them to know that I listened.”\n\n“I have done what I believe God wanted me to do,[1]” he said.\n\nIn fact, Fr.\nWeinandy has bolstered my own “Great Clarifier” theory, saying that this pontificate, and the lack of response to it from priests and bishops, is being allowed by God in order to reveal “just how weak is the faith of many within the Church,” He added that Francis has revealed that many in the Church “hold harmful theological and pastoral views.”\n\nWhich inevitably brings to mind other responses that have not been quite so clear, nor so pastoral.\n\nWhen Cardinal Muller was removed abruptly from his position as head of the CDF, the conservative Catholic world wailed that it was another case of a “good” prelate being got rid of.\nAnd it seems clear from the way it was done, and the way Francis treated Muller in general, that he was indeed got rid of.\nBut his depiction by conservative writers as a beleaguered champion of Catholic orthodoxy persecuted by the regime for his faithfulness betrays a somewhat selective memory and short attention span.\nEd Pentin has a long file of interviews and articles about Muller that clearly show his complete inability to make up his mind whose side he’s on.\n\nA quick examination of Muller’s interviews and statements reveal an irresolute and ultimately calculating mind of a man who is – so I am told by sources close to him – motivated mainly by a puerile desire to be approved of by the “cool kids” in the Vatican, on the one hand, and an unshakeable conviction of his own theological brilliance on the other.\n\nMost recently, on October 30th, Crux quoted him under the headline, “Cardinal Muller backs Pope Francis against critics of ‘Amoris Laetitia’” in which the former head of the CDF has at last climbed on board the Kasperian train on reception of Communion for unrepentant adulterers.\n\nSignaling furiously with the trendy FrancisChurch buzzwords and even trendier blithering incoherence, Muller writes that “mitigating factors in guilt,” can lead, couples in “an uncertain marital situation” through a “path of repentance” – always “accompanied” by an exquisitely sensitive confessor – to a point where the reception of Communion is no longer sinful.\nPresumably because adultery itself is no longer sinful.\nOr sacrilege either, I guess.\nOr something.\nSomehow the “new evangelization” is involved in this, though it’s unclear how exactly it makes adultery and sacrilege OK. Also, it’s very important to fulfill the Sunday Mass obligation, and as everyone knows, one can’t possibly go to Mass on a Sunday without receiving Communion.\n\nWe hear again, as we did incessantly from the Kasperians at the Synods, about the hard case of the poor, poor woman who has been abandoned by the first husband, and who “finds no other way out than to entrust oneself to a kind-hearted person,” … with whom, I guess, she has also no choice but to have sexual relations.\nBecause of kind-heartedness.\n\nAnyway, the result of this is a “marriage-like relationship” about which confessors have to be very careful not to say mean things.\nOr be too “extreme”.\nIt’s very important for him to avoid a “cheap adaptation to the relativistic Zeitgeist,” on one side, and a “cold application of the dogmatic commandments and the canonical rules,” on the other.\nBecause that could be too polarizing.\nAnd mean.\n\nAnd anyway, sins of the flesh aren’t the worst things ever.\nThere are, like, “different levels” of gravity, you know?\nAnd, like, it depends on the type of sin, right?\n“Spirit’s sins” like spiritual pride and avarice and stuff, are worse than “sins of the flesh,” you know?\nWhich are, like, only a result of “human weakness,” right?\n\nApparently the real problem with this whole thing has been that the Kasperian kerfuffle has totally been blown way, way, WAY out of proportion, and the “polarization” it has caused has been “regrettable”.\nThe question of Communion for divorced and civilly “remarried” Catholics, he said, has been “falsely elevated to the rank of a decisive question of Catholicism and a measure of ideological comparison in order to decide whether one is conservative or liberal, in favor or against the pope.”\n\nFor years under Pope Benedict, Muller was engaged in an open war with the German episcopate who insisted that they were going to allow Communion for the divorced and remarried, no matter what Rome said, even threatening to go into schism if they didn’t get their way[2].\n\nMuller, with little backing from Pope Benedict – who appeared content to allow his CDF prefect and the Germans shout out their differences – and with outright opposition from Francis, did indeed strive to hold the line.\nThe fact that Francis orchestrated the Synods to undermine him was certainly not his fault.\nAnd it is difficult to imagine anyone being in a worse position than he was at the time.\n\nBut since then, Muller has demonstrated very little of his former grit, instead attempting from one day to the next to appease both sides.\nReportedly removed from CDF – and of course lionized by “conservatives” – for his mild and equivocating opposition to Amoris Laetitia, Muller has gone back and forth in what can easily be seen as a desperate attempt to find friends in both camps.\nWith this in mind one could be forgiven for not taking his October 30th essay too seriously.\n\nPerhaps one of the good effects to come from Fr.\nWeinandy’s persecution will be to demonstrate how a pastor of the Catholic Church is supposed to act.\nAs my friend said, maybe “it’s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence,” assuming there are any left.\n\nCatch Hilary's regular column in The Remnant's Print\/E-edition.\nSubscribe Today!\n[1] In this interview, Fr.\nWeinandy gave a remarkable story of how his prayer for a “sign” that he ought to write the letter was very specifically answered: “If you want me to write something, you have to give me a clear sign,” Weinandy recalls saying.\n“Tomorrow morning, I’m going to Saint Mary Major’s to pray, and then I am going to Saint John Lateran.\nAfter that, I’m coming back to Saint Peter’s to have lunch with a seminary friend of mine.” “During that interval, I must meet someone that I know but have not seen in a very long time, and would never expect to see in Rome at this time.\nThat person cannot be from the United States, Canada or Great Britain.\nMoreover, that person has to say to me, ‘Keep up the good writing’.” Weinandy said, exactly that happened the next day, in a chance meeting with an archbishop he’d known a long time ago but not seen for over twenty years, who congratulated him for a book on the Incarnation and then said the right words, “Keep up the good writing.” “There was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something,” Weinandy said.\n[2] It’s notable that these howling tantrums from the German bishops halted abruptly about the same time as Cardinal Kasper gave his infamous consistory speech in February 2014.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Anti-Gay Imam Featured Yet Again at Florida Democrat Gala\n\nThe Democratic Party promotes itself as an advocacy group for all matters concerning homosexuals and labels politicians, who take stances opposite theirs on politically charged issues such as same-sex marriage, as bigots.\nYet, the party keeps on inviting an imam, who has a long record of hostility toward homosexuals, to participate at its annual functions.\nThis blatant hypocrisy shows the political bankruptcy of their leadership’s claims to be pro-gay and anti-bigotry and reveals their intention to pander to those in the Muslim community who spew intolerance and would wish others harm.\nOn Saturday, October 7, 2017, the Palm Beach Democratic Party held its 2017 Truman Kennedy Johnson (TKJ) Dinner at the West Palm Beach Marriott Hotel, in West Palm Beach, Florida.\nThe Keynote Speaker at the event was Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe.\nOther speakers included: United States Representative Alcee Hastings; then-Florida Democratic Party Chairman Stephen Bittel, who resigned in November over allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior; and then-Palm Beach County Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo, who was elected in December to take over for Bittel as Chair of the Florida Democratic Party.\nPrior to the speakers, there was a joint invocation performed by a rabbi, two pastors and an imam.\nThe imam, Maulana Shafayat Mohamed, is notorious for his unapologetic vilification of homosexuals.\nShafayat Mohamed is the imam of the Darul Uloom Institute, located in Pembroke Pines, Florida.\nThe mosque has been a haven for terror-related individuals and activity.\n“Dirty Bomber” Jose Padilla was a student of Shafayat Mohamed’s at Darul Uloom.\nNow-deceased al-Qaeda Global Operations Chief, Adnan el-Shukrijumah, was a prayer leader at Darul Uloom.\nAnd Darul Uloom Arabic teacher Imran Mandhai, along with mosque goers Hakki Aksoy and Shueyb Mossa Jokhan, hatched a plot at the mosque to blow up different South Florida structures, including area power stations, Jewish businesses, and a National Guard armory.\nWhile terrorism plays a huge role in his mosque’s history – and he has been around for all of it – Shafayat Mohamed’s personal history deals much more in bigotry than terror.\nOne stop on Shafayat Mohamed’s Facebook page and one can view his profile photo of him holding a dark green book with gold border and letters on the cover.\nThe book is “The Meaning of THE HOLY QUR’AN,” a version of the Quran that was banned by the Los Angeles public school system, in February 2002, for containing numerous anti-Semitic commentaries.\nIn it, Jews are described as: “arrogant,” “jealous,” “selfish,” “spiteful,” “greedy,” “cursed,” “apes and swine,” and “under divine displeasure.”\nThis may seem an innocent mistake on the imam’s part, but his actions against the gay community and sinister views are anything but.\nIn February 2005, an article written by Shafayat Mohamed was published on the Darul Uloom website, entitled ‘Tsunami: Wrath of God.’ In it, he claims that gay sex caused the 2004 Indonesian tsunami and that most Jews and Christians, whom he refers to as “People of the Book,” are “perverted transgressors.”\nIt is writings such as these that have gotten Shafayat Mohamed thrown off a number of Broward County boards.\nEven so, the imam has been unrepentant.\nIn a speech he gave at Darul Uloom, in August 2015, titled ‘Quraan Torah Bible Forbid Man Marrying Man,’ he admitted that he “got sacked from many [county] boards, because there were a lot of gay people who said, ‘We don’t want him on that board.’” He said he had a choice, to “sit in Paradise or… sit on the board and go to Hell.”\nHe began his speech by attacking President Barack Obama for supporting same-sex marriage.\nHe asked the following, “Did you hear what President Obama said?… Do you know what a sad situation we are in this country?...\nHere you have the President of the United States of America saying that a man could marry a man?… Are we sleeping?\nDo you believe in the Quran?\nAre we gonna sit and have the Quran be ridiculed?” He then cited the Christian and Jewish Bible, barking loudly, “The Bible says that if a man sleeps with a man, he should be killed!”\nShafayat Mohamed later lamented the existence of Muslim homosexuals.\nHe decried, “Listen.\nDon’t deny it.\nThey already got Muslim gay communities.” He as well spoke of his support for polygamy, an act that is illegal in the United States.\nHe exclaimed, “Here the President says a man can marry a man, but you can’t say a man can have four wives…!”\nThe October TKJ Dinner was not the first Democrat event Shafayat Mohamed has participated in.\nIn fact, he has been involved in many, including giving the invocations at the Florida Democratic Party’s annual Leadership Blue Gala in 2014 (featuring Bill Clinton), 2015 and 2016.\nAnd given that this author has written about this before, the October event will probably not be the last occasion that he is embraced by the Democratic Party.\nShafayat Mohamed is not the only Muslim extremist that has participated in the Democratic Party’s TKJ Dinner.\nIn October 2015, the dinner invocation was performed by Wilfredo Amr Ruiz, the legal adviser of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA), a group that actively promotes former KKK leader and white supremacist David Duke.\nRuiz, as well, founded AMANA’s Connecticut and Puerto Rico chapters.\nIn July 2010, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Ruiz’s AMANA for posting what the ADL called a “venomous” anti-Semitic Duke video onto the group’s official website.\nAMANA is currently promoting another anti-Semitic Duke-produced video, on the AMANA site.\nThe President of AMANA, Sofian Zakkout, has referred to Duke as “David Duke, a man to believe in!”\nBy inviting people like Shafayat Mohamed, an avowed enemy of the gay community, and Wilfredo Ruiz, whose group promotes white supremacists, to participate in its functions, the Democratic Party has effectively revealed its disregard for the concerns of those it disingenuously claims to advocate for and protect.\nIt is time for Democrats to reject the bigotry of these radicals and see them for the liability they present.\nFailure to do so exposes the party’s liberal agenda as a sham.\nBeila Rabinowitz, Director of Militant Islam Monitor, contributed to this report.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War\n\nIf you are to believe the official story, one of America’s deadliest wars in history, Vietnam, was started after the United States had been attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin in the South China Sea.\nHowever, over the past 54 years, a deluge of information and government officials have come forward showing that most everything the government and the media told Americans about the Gulf of Tonkin was a lie.\nOften, the American mainstream media becomes a de facto government employee, taking the claims of U.S. officials and reporting them as proven fact — and nothing exemplifies this penchant better than reporting on the Gulf of Tonkin incident — perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up as a justification for war.\nAccording to the widely discredited official story, on August 2, 1964, the destroyer USS Maddox, while performing a signals intelligence patrol as part of DESOTO operations, was pursued by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats of the 135th Torpedo Squadron.\nThe North Vietnamese torpedo boats then attacked with torpedoes and machine gun fire.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\n* Yes, he will be confirmed.\nNo, he will not be confirmed.\nEmail *\nPhone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nTwo days later, according to the official story, on August 4, 1962, the NSA reported that a second Gulf of Tonkin incident occurred and US ships were attacked once again.\nThe next day, without question, on August 5, 1964, the New York Times reported “President Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and ‘certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam’ after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.” Additional outlets, such as the Washington Post, echoed this claim.\nThe outcome of these two incidents was the passage by Congress of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted then-President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by “communist aggression.” The resolution served as Johnson’s legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.\nAs a result, 58,177 Americans would lose their lives.\nAdditionally, over one million North and South Vietnamese, including 627,000 civilians would be slaughtered.\nBut it wasn’t true.\nAt all.\nIn fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam — leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese, fomenting the largest anti-war movement in American history, and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world.\nThe truth of the matter was that the Maddox was engaged in an aggressive intelligence gathering operation working hand in hand in coordinated attacks on North Vietnam by the South Vietnamese navy and the Laotian air force.\nWhen the government announced that it had been the victim of an unprovoked attack—this was a lie.\nIn the 2003 documentary The Fog of War , the former United States Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara admitted that the August 4 Gulf of Tonkin attack never happened.\nIn 1995, McNamara met with former Vietnam People’s Army General Võ Nguyên Giáp to ask what happened on August 4, 1964 in the second Gulf of Tonkin Incident.\n“Absolutely nothing”, Giáp replied.\nGiáp claimed that the attack had been imaginary.\nIn 2010, more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released, proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House.\nBut while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn’t be disputed.\nTom Wells, author of the exhaustive exposé “The War Within: America’s Battle Over Vietnam ,” explained the media egregiously erred in “almost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information” and “reluctance to question official pronouncements on ‘national security issues.’”\nIf due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it’s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did and over a million lives would’ve been saved.\nNow, retired military officials—who pay attention to history—are even warning about more staged events to pull us into war.\n“I think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident,” Col. Macgregor said.\n“Many of your viewers may not remember that it never happened and we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf.\nWe should watch for that, and this is an example of President Trump’s comments on fake news, he should not be sabotaged by fake news.”\nIndeed, as TFTP has reported at length, nearly all wars in US history have been started over false information.\nTo see a full list of our data, you can click this link.\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\n>","completion":" Exaggeration,Minimisation|149|174\nExaggeration,Minimisation|751|785\nName_Calling,Labeling|831|849\nFlag-Waving|2641|2650\nLoaded_Language|2771|2782\nLoaded_Language|2804|2810\nLoaded_Language|3282|3292\nLoaded_Language|756|769\nLoaded_Language|2990|3007."}
{"prompt":"No sign of breakthrough after Pompeo meets with Saudi rulers over missing journalist\n\nWASHINGTON — On an emergency mission to resolve a diplomatic crisis, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo held delicate talks Tuesday with the rulers of Saudi Arabia amid growing suspicions that a Virginia-based Saudi columnist was killed on their orders.\nPompeo did not report any progress following a day of meetings in Riyadh with Saudi King Salman and his powerful son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler.\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday ordered Pompeo to rush to the desert kingdom to try to determine the fate of the missing journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, and the diplomat quickly hopped a plane.\nIn his meetings, Pompeo conveyed “U.S.\nconcern” about Khashoggi’s disappearance two weeks ago, the State Department said, and stressed “the importance of a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation.”\nThe talks were “direct and candid,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.\nPompeo reminded his hosts that despite the numerous bilateral issues the two governments share, determining Khashoggi’s fate was the urgent purpose of this trip, she said.\nKhashoggi, a prominent critic of the autocratic Saudi leadership, was last seen entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on Oct. 2, where he was seeking papers to marry his fiancée.\nTurkish media reports, based in part on apparent audio recordings, have said Khashoggi was beaten to death and then dismembered in the building.\nA 15-member Saudi military team had entered the consulate with a bone saw shortly before Khashoggi arrived, and flew out of the country soon after, the reports said.\nSaudi officials insisted that Khashoggi left the consulate but have provided no video or other evidence.\nThey have denied any responsibility for his disappearance.\nHoping to stem a growing furor, Trump on Monday suggested “rogue killers,” not the Saudi royal family, may have carried out the murder.\nCritics quickly said that Trump was providing an excuse for the Saudi leaders, and participating in a cover-up.\nThat seemed to set the stage for Saudi officials to find a way to explain away the alleged shocking death.\nThey floated the idea later Monday of claiming that Khashoggi, who wrote opinion pieces for the Washington Post and Arab media, was accidentally killed in an interrogation gone awry inside the consulate — supposedly without the approval of the king or crown prince.\nPublicly, Pompeo and his hosts looked calm and friendly when they met Tuesday in Riyadh.\nAt one point, as they greeted each other, Prince Mohammed noted the two countries were important allies.\n“Absolutely,” Pompeo said, smiling.\nThe United States long guaranteed Saudi security in exchange for a steady supply of oil.\nThose ties have frayed even as the Trump administration has embraced the Saudi rulers as a crucial regional ally in efforts to constrain Iran and to craft a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians.\nThe current crisis has put those broader goals at risk, and the White House has scrambled to find a face-saving solution for the Saudi rulers.\nTrump has said he would impose “severe” punishment if proof emerges that Saudi rulers sanctioned Khashoggi’s murder, but he has not said what that would entail.\nHe has ruled out cancelling or suspending billions of dollars in arms deals with the oil-rich country.\nMany members of Congress have demanded the White House take tougher actions, including punitive sanctions on Saudi rulers.\nBut Congress has taken no action on its own.\n— Tracy Wilkinson\nLos Angeles Times\n———\n©2018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|2185|2199\nLoaded_Language|105|114\nLoaded_Language|575|579\nLoaded_Language|700|706\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1462|1498\nLoaded_Language|3165|3173."}

{"prompt":"Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan\n\nThe media has maintained a tight embargo on the release of the photo of Obama meeting with Nation of Islam hate group leader Louis Farrakhan at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting.\nAlmost no national media outlet has covered the story.\nCNN only mentioned it when it embedded Jake Tapper's tweets about the support for Farrakhan by Women's March leaders.\nBut Rep. Danny Davis had defended Farrakhan.\nDemocratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis defended Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as an “outstanding human being” on Monday.\nFarrakhan’s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks, saying white people “deserve to die” and praising Adolf Hitler as a “very great man.” “I personally know [Farrakhan], I’ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,” Davis told TheDC.\nThe JTA's awkward attempt to whitewash the newly revealed CBC anti-Semitism included a claim from the ADL that Rep. Davis had been misquoted.\nAn ADL official told JTA on Friday that the group had reached out to Rep. Danny Davis, a Democrat, after an article in The Daily Caller said he lauded Farrakhan on Monday as “an outstanding human being.” Farrakhan has calledJews “the enemy of God and the enemy of the righteous,” and said Jews were responsible for the 9\/11 terror attacks and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the 20th century.\n“The congressman was insistent that The Daily Caller misquoted him during the interview and that he didn’t subscribe to Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic statements and actions in the past,” the ADL official told JTA in a statement.\n“He expressed an interest in seeing some of the latest statements made by Farrakhan vis-a-vis Jews, which we promptly shared with him.” The official said the ADL had shared information with Davis about Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic statements, and that the organization was waiting to hear back from him.\nNow, Rep. Davis would really like to emphasize that the ADL is wrong and he loves Farrakhan.\nDemocratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis confirmed in an interview Sunday that he has a personal relationship with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a notorious anti-Semite, and said he isn’t bothered by Farrakhan’s position on “the Jewish question.” Farrakhan has repeatedly denounced Jews as “satanic,” praised Hitler as a “very great man” and has said that white people “deserve to die.” The congressman wasn’t sure why the ADL wrote that he had been misquoted in his praise for the anti-Semite, and said he wasn’t sure if someone from his office had told the ADL he was misquoted, he told The Daily Caller News Foundation on Sunday.\n“I think that was what they wanted to write.\nNah, I don’t have no problems with Farrakhan, I don’t spend a whole lot of my time dealing with those kind of things,” Davis said.\n“That’s just one segment of what goes on in our world.\nThe world is so much bigger than Farrakhan and the Jewish question and his position on that and so forth.\nFor those heavy into it, that’s their thing, but it ain’t my thing,” he said\nThe people who talk about the \"Jewish question\" are generally anti-Semites.\nSomehow I don't think a white congressman would get away with saying that he agrees with David Duke on the environment but isn't especially concerned about his racism.\nBut black leaders have gotten away with playing that game with Farrakhan repeatedly.\nBut the ADL and the JTA will whitewash this again.\nAnd if they can't whitewash this, they'll ignore it.\n>","completion":" Repetition|3467|3476\nLoaded_Language|914|942\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|1250|1437\nThought-terminating_Cliches|2926|3030\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|3489|3540\nRepetition|1440|1526\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|2015|2054\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|2334|2446\nCausal_Oversimplification|3109|3183."}
{"prompt":"Chile 'cover-up' letter contradicts Pope\n\n© EPA Pope Francis's trip to Chile and Peru was overshadowed by he row\nA victim of a paedophile priest in Chile has revealed he wrote to the Pope in 2015 about an alleged cover-up after Francis denied getting evidence.\nJuan Carlos Cruz, a victim of cleric Fernando Karadima in the 1980s, accused fellow priest Juan Barros of witnessing the abuse and doing nothing.\nThe Pope caused outrage after a visit to Chile last month by defending Bishop Barros, who was made a bishop in 2015.\nThe Vatican refused to comment on the letter when approached by BBC News.\nPope Francis has said in the past that dealing with abuse is vital for the Church's credibility and perpetrators must face \"sanctions\".\nWhat allegations does the letter make?\nMr Cruz sent the text of his letter (written in Spanish) to BBC News, showing it was addressed personally to Pope Francis and dated 3 March 2015.\nThat was more than two weeks before the bishop's ordination in the south Chilean city of Osorno, an event dramatically disrupted by hundreds of protesters accusing Bishop Barros of covering up Karadima's sex attacks on young boys.\nThe bishop has denied ever knowing about \"the serious abuses\" committed by Karadima, who was never prosecuted in Chile because so much time had passed but was convicted and sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of \"penance and prayer\".\n\"Holy Father, I decided to write this letter to you because I'm tired of fighting, crying and suffering,\" Mr Cruz writes.\n© AFP Cardinal O'Malley (centre) accompanied the Pope in Latin America\n\"Our story is well known and there's no point reminding you of it, except to tell you of the horror of having experienced this abuse and how I wanted to kill myself.\"\nIn his letter, he also attaches the full text of a previous letter written a month earlier to the Vatican's top diplomat in Chile, Archbishop Ivo Scapolo.\nIn that letter, Mr Cruz accuses Bishop Barros of \"doing all the dirty work of Fernando Karadima\", and describes the abuse he suffered and which Bishop Barros allegedly witnessed.\n\"When we were in a room with Karadima and Juan Barros, if he [Barros] wasn't kissing Karadima, he watched as one of us, the youngest, was touched by Karadima and forced to give him kisses,\" he writes.\n\"Karadima would say to me: 'Put your mouth next to mine and stick out your tongue.'\nHe'd stick out his and kiss us with his tongue.\nJuan Barros witnessed all of this on countless occasions, not just in my case but in the case of others as well.\"\nAddressing himself to Pope Francis, Mr Cruz says: \"Holy Father, Juan Barros says he saw nothing and yet, there are dozens of us who can testify to the fact that not only was he present when Karadima abused us, but that he, too, kissed Karadima and they touched each other.\"\nHe concludes the letter with this appeal: \"Please Holy Father, don't be like the others.\nThere are so many of us who despite everything think that you can do something.\nI treasure my faith, it's what sustains me, but it is slipping away from me.\"\nHasn't the Pope already apologised?\n© AFP Karadima was only punished by the Vatican\nThe remarks that the Pope had made in January that caused such offence were: \"The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will speak.\nThere is not a single piece of proof against him.\nEverything is slander.\nIs this clear?\"\nThe Pope later apologised for hurting victims' feelings \"without meaning to\" but continued to insist there was \"no evidence\" against the bishop.\n\"In Barros's case, it was studied,\" he said.\n\"It was restudied.\nAnd there is no evidence...\nI don't have evidence to convict.\"\nHow far did the letter get?\n© Reuters Bishop Barros (centre) was greeted by angry protesters at his ordination\nMembers of the Pope's own Commission for the Protection of Minors, set up in 2014 as part of efforts to counter sex abuse by clergy, have told the Associated Press they hand-delivered the letter to Francis's top adviser on sex abuse, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, in April 2015.\nA photo in the AP report shows Marie Collins, a member of the commission at the time, handing the letter to the cardinal.\n\"When we gave him the letter for the Pope, he assured us he would give it to the Pope and speak of the concerns,\" she told AP.\n\"And at a later date, he assured us that that had been done.\"\nMr Cruz told the BBC that Cardinal O'Malley had called him later in 2015 to say he had given the letter to the Pope.\nCardinal O'Malley, whose spokesman referred requests for comment to the Vatican, has earned respect for his work in tackling sex abuse by clergy in Boston.\nCardinal O'Malley's disgraced predecessor, the late Cardinal Bernard Law, had moved paedophile priests between parishes rather than addressing victims' claims.\nIn an unusual step, Cardinal O'Malley openly criticised the Pope last month for his initial remarks in Chile, saying he had left victims feeling abandoned.\nPope Francis announced last week he was sending the Vatican's top expert on sexual abuse, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to Chile to investigate the accusations against Bishop Barros.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Sodom and Gomorrah was Judged by God Because Men Refused to Keep His Commandments in Dealing with the Wicked!\n\n“How ridiculous to overlook judgment because of kindness then love wounds itself by killing justice!” -Charles Haddon Spurgeon\nHow often I see and hear the professors of Christianity today walking contrary to the word and spirit of the Living Christ (2 Corinthians 3:6).\nHow willing they are to overlook judgment when it comes to the criminals that run rampant in this country, and on the other hand how willing they are to show compassion to the criminals while overlooking the victims.\nWhy?\n“Evil men understand not judgment” (Proverbs 28:5).\nIf you read the preceding verse, you will see that Scripture tells us “they that forsake the law praise the wicked.”\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\n* Yes, he will be confirmed.\nNo, he will not be confirmed.\nEmail *\nPhone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nThis is exactly the Scriptural point that I want to make.\nFrom the pulpits in America today we here the events unfold of Sodom and Gomorra and how Abraham should have prayed longer in hopes that God would have spared them rather than the righteous people in Sodom and Gomorra doing what God had commanded.\nAnd of course, not a second thought on man's behalf is given concerning the victims in these two cities.\nHere is Abraham’s account…\n“And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.\nAnd the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?\nFor I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.\nAnd the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.\nAnd the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.\nAnd Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?\nPeradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?\nThat be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\nAnd the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.\nAnd Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five?\nAnd he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.\nAnd he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there.\nAnd he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.\nAnd he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there.\nAnd he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.\nAnd he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto theLord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there.\nAnd he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.\nAnd he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there.\nAnd he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.\nAnd the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.\"\n-Genesis 18:16-33\nGot questions.org explains very well…\nGenesis chapter 19 records the two angels, disguised as human men, visiting Sodom and Gomorrah.\nLot met the angels in the city square and urged them to stay at his house.\nThe angels agreed.\nThe Bible then informs us, \"Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom — both young and old — surrounded the house.\nThey called to Lot, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight?\nBring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.\nGenesis 19:4-5 The angels then proceed to blind all the men of Sodom and Gomorrah and urge Lot and his family to flee from the cities to escape the wrath that God was about to deliver.\nLot and his family flee the city, and then \"the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah — from the LORD out of the heavens.\nThus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities...\" (Genesis 19:2 4) .\nIn light of the passage, the most common response to the question, \"What was the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah?\"\nis that it was homosexuality.\nThat is how the term ”sodomy” came to be used to refer to anal sex between two men, whether consensual or forced.\nClearly, homosexuality was part of the reason God destroyed the two cities.\nThe men of Sodom and Gomorrah wanted to perform homosexual gang rape on the two angels, who were disguised as men.\nAt the same time, it is not biblical to say that homosexuality was the exclusive reason why God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.\nThe cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were definitely not exclusive in terms of the sins in which they indulged.\nEzekiel 16:49-50 declares, \"Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.\nThey were haughty and did detestable things before me...\" The Hebrew word translated \"detestable\" refers to something that is morally disgusting and is the exact same word used in Leviticus 18:22 that refers to homosexuality as an \"abomination.\"\nSimilarly, Jude 7 declares, \"...Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion.\"\nSo, again, while homosexuality was not the only sin in which the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah indulged, it does appear to be the primary reason for the destruction of the cities.\nThose who attempt to explain away the biblical condemnations of homosexuality claim that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was inhospitality.\nThe men of Sodom and Gomorrah were certainly being inhospitable.\nThere is probably nothing more inhospitable than homosexual gang rape.\nBut to say God completely destroyed two cities and all their inhabitants for being inhospitable clearly misses the point.\nWhile Sodom and Gomorrah were guilty of many other horrendous sins, homosexuality was the reason God poured fiery sulfur on the cities, completely destroying them and all of their inhabitants.\nTo this day, the area where Sodom and Gomorrah were located remains a desolate wasteland.\nSodom and Gomorrah serve as a powerful example of how God feels about sin in general, and homosexuality specifically.\nThe point is that there were no righteous to be spared and the Lord did what man failed to do when they had the time to do it.\nQuestion: How do you show mercy to a people who observe lying vanities (Jonah 2:4) and refuse to return to the Lord (Jeremiah 6:16) on His terms?\n(Jeremiah 22:3) God must be true and judgment must commence.\nMen today, like those of Sodom and Gomorrah, are not valiant for the truth.\nThey are valiant to proceed from evil to evil (Jeremiah 5).\nThey care more about the pleasures of sin for a season, than they are grieved for the afflictions of Joseph (Amos 6:6; Hebrews 11:25).\nMen today care more of compromise (where two men both agree on what they both know is wrong) and diplomacy (seduction in another guise) in promoting anarchy through “antinomianism” than they do the Law of God against the sins unto judgment that enslave men (John 8:34).\nInstead of establishing judgment within the gate and hating the evil and loving the good (Amos 5:15) in hopes that the Lord may be gracious to their repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10), they reject the counsel of God against them by hating the good and loving the evil, and that to their own damnation.\nThey care more about the approbation and favor of men than they do that of the Living God and what His Word declares (Galatians 1:10),not knowing that which his highly favored among men is an abomination unto the Lord (Luke 16:15).\nThey wear the cross.\nYet, they have no testimony of the power of God unto salvation by the cross because they do not practice what Christ required: “Deny yourselves and take up your cross and follow Me” (Matthew 16:24; Romans 1:16; 2 Corinthians 5:15, 13:4-5; Galatians 2:21).\nProfessed Christians in America today talk much of love through inaction, and yet know nothing of it (1 John 3:18).\nThey read what to do, but do it not!\nIn fact, they declare and proclaim how much they love God, and yet if you were to have them read His moral law and look to their own lives, they would find how much they actually hate God through their actions (Matthew 15:8).\nThen again, these were the same types of people in Jerusalem crying out \"Crucify him!\nCrucify him!\nWe have no king but Caesar\" (John 19:15).\nAnd these are the same people today persecuting living Christians while praising the dead ones (Matthew 5:10).\nThey continuously preach of the heroism of Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David, Gideon, Samson and others from the pulpit and fail to understand what these men were doing when serving their generations (Psalm 71:18-19; Isaiah 51:4).\nToday, instead of doing the same, they simply hide under a false grace (Isaiah 30) and give themselves over to a man, the president, and declare end times.\nThey declare we're in the end times because they have failed to stand up and fight for their posterity in keeping the Lord's commandments and His judgments (Psalm 78:1-11).\nUngrateful reprobates, pretenders, counterfeits and hypocrites are what they are (Matthew 23:3).\nInstead of reaching out to the greatest demographic here in America, public high schools, they send missionaries to foreign lands to do there what they fail to do for their own here.\nInstead of fighting for their posterity and shutting down the illegalities of sodomy in all 50 states, they teach them to just do their best to understand that they cannot help themselves while God say’s the opposite (Leviticus 20:18).\nInstead of fighting on their behalf against the federal government that is illegally indoctrinating them, they simply give their kids over to them to be dumbed down.\nAnd instead of protesting the murder of 58 million innocent babies (Proverbs 6:17), they merely pass it off as a \"choice,\" that being the lessons that they learned from the media that they say that they do not believe (Romans 1:18).\nThe American Church, instead of protesting corruption in government through the example of the Biblical patriarchs and our American forefathers (Matthew 5:17-18), teach to submit to tyranny as if to suggest that it is somehow obedience to God (Romans 12:21).\nThe Church in America has failed to keep the Commandments of the God of Israel.\nInstead of preaching out against sin, they advocate for that which God clearly condemns, thereby making war against God (Micah 3:5), which at length destroys our government, our country and our families.\nLook to their feigned strength that they profess to possess.\nIt is gauged by simply looking to the prevailing immoralities and debauchers of society.\nThey are weak and pathetic and they have no excuses as to why America is where we is today!\nWhy did God judge Sodom and Gomorrah?\nIt's the same reason that he is judging America today (Amos 4:12), He cannot find the righteous in order to spare her (Jeremiah 22:3).\nDefining the Wicked…\nWicked men in the sight of God are those who have the knowledge of what to do when it comes to the right, but over and over again, they turn their shoulders and choose the wrong, through tolerance and apathy Americans are bringing upon themselves destruction (Deuteronomy 30:19) that will not be reversed, which leaves no alternative as to why God judges and is judging America today (Deuteronomy 28:63).\nArticle posted with permission from Sons Of Liberty Media\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|460|471\nLoaded_Language|7029|7044\nLoaded_Language|7079|7098\nName_Calling,Labeling|10249|10311\nName_Calling,Labeling|4963|4971\nName_Calling,Labeling|5923|6076\nName_Calling,Labeling|6255|6266\nDoubt|11503|11705\nCausal_Oversimplification|0|108\nName_Calling,Labeling|98|108\nLoaded_Language|112|126\nLoaded_Language|173|210\nDoubt|238|360\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|727|770\nDoubt|382|597\nName_Calling,Labeling|2681|2691\nName_Calling,Labeling|2662|2675\nName_Calling,Labeling|2721|2730\nRepetition|2809|2818\nName_Calling,Labeling|2892|2905\nRepetition|2911|2921\nName_Calling,Labeling|2932|2945\nName_Calling,Labeling|2959|2969\nName_Calling,Labeling|3085|3094\nName_Calling,Labeling|3326|3335\nLoaded_Language|4699|4732\nLoaded_Language|4972|4998\nLoaded_Language|5533|5589\nLoaded_Language|6149|6167\nLoaded_Language|6346|6400\nLoaded_Language|6785|6854\nCausal_Oversimplification|7046|7169\nCausal_Oversimplification|7261|7377\nName_Calling,Labeling|7411|7420\nRepetition|8553|8562\nName_Calling,Labeling|9062|9099\nLoaded_Language|10840|10869\nName_Calling,Labeling|11255|11307\nLoaded_Language|11333|11353\nLoaded_Language|11802|11855\nDoubt|9062|9438\nDoubt|10346|10762\nDoubt|10765|10929\nDoubt|10931|11420\nDoubt|11423|11501\nDoubt|11707|11947\nCausal_Oversimplification|11987|12104\nName_Calling,Labeling|12069|12082\nName_Calling,Labeling|12131|12141\nDoubt|12322|12401\nLoaded_Language|12365|12401\nCausal_Oversimplification|12449|12526\nDoubt|7516|7650\nFlag-Waving|10346|10527\nFlag-Waving|11857|11947."}

{"prompt":"Hungarian Prime Minister: ‘Christianity is Europe’s last hope’\n\nNewsFaith, Politics - World\nBUDAPEST, Hungary, February 19, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Brushing aside any semblance of political correctness, Hungary’s Prime Minister said in his state of the nation speech on Sunday that, “Christianity is Europe's last hope.”\nAddressing his country and the world, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán warned that European nations which have encouraged migration have, “opened the way to the decline of Christian culture and the advance of Islam.”\nOrbán painted an image of Western Europe being overwhelmed by the accelerating influx Muslim immigrants in recent years.\n“According to estimates, the proportion of immigrants will grow at an accelerated pace in the European countries west of us,” said Orbán.\n“I won't even say anything about France and Holland, but even the born Germans are being forced back from most large German cities as migrants always occupy big cities first.”\nOrbán warned that as Western Europe becomes saturated with Muslim occupants, Islamists would soon seek to stream in to his country from both Western Europe as well as from Islamic nations.\n“This means that the Islamic civilization, which always considers its vocation to convert Europe to what it calls the true faith, in the future will be knocking on the door of Central Europe not only from the south, but from the west, as well,” he said.\nPrime Minister Orbán said his government will oppose efforts by the United Nations or the European Union to “increase migration” around the world.\nIn June, LifeSiteNews reported that Orbán had taken a strong stand and not backed down against outside globalist influences seeking to control his nation’s politics.\nBillionaire George Soros, who famously backs many progressive initiatives around the world, locked horns with Orbán over the Central European University (CEU) he founded in 1989, which has been criticized as a funnel for anti-nationalist views.\nOrbán and Soros have a history, beginning in partnership and ending in acrimony.\nOrbán started public life as a crusader against communism and attended Oxford University on a Soros scholarship.\nSoros, who expatriated from Hungary, also funded Orbán’s political organization, the Alliance for Young Democrats.\nBut Orbán’s defense of conservative values has led to breaking ties with Soros, whom he now criticizes as a foreigner meddling in his country’s affairs.\nAfter Prime Minister Orbán delivered his strongly worded state of the nation speech, a UK Daily Mail report said, “Orbán has conflated the issue of immigration with the image of Soros, 87, whose name was used in a tough anti-migrant bill sent to Parliament on Wednesday.”\nThe Daily Mail report continued:\nSoros, for his part, compared Orbán unfavourably to both the Nazis and the Communists, saying his rule evoked dark tones from the 1930's, when Hungary was allied with Nazi Germany.\nBut Orbán remains committed to his policy, claiming that Soros and supporters of migration are losing the fight.\nHe said: “Soros has antagonised not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too.\nEverywhere he wants to get migration accepted.\nIt won't work.\nWe are not alone and we will fight together and we will succeed.”\nIn addition to inviting Soros’ ire, Orbán came under fire a couple years ago from the U.S. State Department under President Obama as well as the European Parliament for purportedly discriminating against homosexuals because of Hungary’s insistence on defining marriage between a man and a woman, and that pre-born babies have rights.\nLast year, Orbán also criticized liberals and encouraged citizens to give life to more children during the 11th conference of the World Congress of Families.\nThree thousand “natural family” advocates who attended the four-day conference heard Orbán in his opening address lambaste the European Union (EU) for its “relativizing liberal ideology that’s an insult to families.”\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_fear-prejudice|1172|1283\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|2755|2819\nFlag-Waving|281|318\nFlag-Waving|397|530\nName_Calling,Labeling|1930|1965\nName_Calling,Labeling|2607|2666\nSlogans|27|61\nSlogans|281|318\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|987|1153\nName_Calling,Labeling|2384|2427."}

{"prompt":"FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976\n\nOn that occasion Archbishop Lefebvre delivered an address on the desperate state of the Church at that time—42 years ago—that was never transcribed or published until we did so for the December 15, 2017 print edition of The Remnant.\nIt was held at the Radisson South Hotel, Minneapolis, on Tuesday, May 12, 1976, and its stated purpose was to assist the Archbishop in gaining a stronger foothold for the Society of St. Pius X in the States during the unprecedented crisis Blessed Pope Paul had helped unleash on the Church.\nI’m posting the address here because I'm convinced the Archbishop’s words provide recent recruits to Tradition with vital historical context for the diabolical debacle that is the pontificate of Pope Francis.\nAnd for those of us who’ve been in the trenches for a long, long time it also provides welcome reminder of why we must continue to fight.\nEven though I personally was in attendance back in 1976 when Archbishop Lefebvre delivered this address in Minneapolis, I was only ten years old and of course didn't realize how prophetic he was on that occasion, or how devastated by the Second Vatican Council, the New Mass, and the Freemasonic infiltration of the Vatican.\nIn fact, this transcript reads like a message of encouragement at a crucial moment in the history of this movement—Stay in the fight!\nKeep the Faith.\nNever surrender!\nThis address also makes it absolutely clear that everything Archbishop Lefebvre did was part of an eleventh-hour defence of the Kingship of Christ (ignored completely by the Second Vatican Council) and a desperate last stand for Tradition, the infallible teachings of Mother Church and of course her ancient liturgy.\nAnd now that Pope Francis has inadvertently unmasked the true spirit of Vatican II, it becomes obvious how and why those who resisted that spirit were right to have done so and will certainly be hailed by history as the heroic band of Catholic brothers that mounted the twentieth century’s last stand for Christ the King and, while scorned and mocked at the time, were nevertheless totally vindicated fifty years later.\nMay we continue to earn the right to stand with them today.\nMJM\nThe Archbishop Speaks\nLadies and Gentlemen:\nAs I said to Mr. [Walter] Matt, I can say in bad English what he says in good English, because he said all of the things I want to say [Referring here to Walter Matt’s introductory talk referenced above.]\nAnd I thank you, Mr. Matt, very much, for his invitation, and I thank you for your coming, and I thank Fr.\nWard for what he said about the Society of St. Pius X.\nAnd I hope that you can understand my poor English, but I think it is better to speak some bad English because to translate would take too much time.\nAs Mr. Matt said, the crisis in the Church is very extraordinary.\nIt is very difficult to understand the situation today.\nMy seminary in Econe (in Switzerland) and the seminaries in Germany and here in America, in Armada, are in very difficult situations with Rome.\nWhy?\nThese seminaries are the same as seminaries were before the Second Vatican Council.\nThey have the same discipline and the same studies, they make good priests; I think they are good seminarians.\nAll is done as all the seminaries before the Second Vatican Council.\nWhy are we now in this very sad situation with Rome?\nI think that because in the Second Vatican Council, and after the Council, there is a mutation, a change, in the Church.\nBut we do not change.\nWe continue the Tradition.\nSo why do they now say, as Mgr.\n(Archbishop) Benelli[1] said to me months ago on the 19th of March, “you are out of communion with the Church.” I am out of communion with the Church because I continue the Tradition of the Church?\nThis is possible?\nI do not understand.\nWhy?\nI have done nothing.\nI believe nothing other than what the Church has believed for twenty centuries.\nMgr.\nBenelli then said to me, you must put down in a writing to the Holy Father that you accept the Second Vatican Council, you accept the reform that followed the Council, and that you accept the orientations that have been given by Rome.\nMgr.\nBenelli took the book of the New Ordo, gave it to me, and said, “You must say this New Mass in all of your houses.”\nI wonder why Mgr.\nBenelli did not communicate this condition to me before our meeting.\n[2] He could have done so.\nFor example, one year ago three cardinals sent me a letter (Cardinals Wright, Tabera [Arturo Carinal Tabera Araoz, one of the Council Fathers MJM], and Gabriel-Marie Garrone) telling me (in effect) that I must close the seminaries.\nWell, I refused, because I refuse to contribute to the destruction of the Church.\nBecause now they are destroying the Church.\nWhen I die and go before the judge, God will not be able to say to me, “You destroyed the Church.” I refused to contribute to the destruction of the Church.\nI am sure that my seminaries are contributing to the restoration of the Church.\nI do not destroy the Church.\nAnd so I said to Mgr.\nBenelli, “No, I will not sign that writing.”\nI think that the mutation in the Church came in through the Second Vatican Council.\nAnd do you think this change in the Church came suddenly?\nWhen, then?\nAt the beginning of the Council?\nNo, this change in the Church began one century before [the Council].\nPope Pius VI said during the French Revolution that if the Church continues to remain under the influence of the prince of the revolution, then, in the future a crisis will come upon the Church.\nIn [1844], Pope Pius IX ordered Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.\n[3] The Pope himself asked Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.\nAnd what did these Instructions say?\nThe Instructions said that they [the Carbonari\/Freemasons] must begin to fight against the Church by bringing reform into the Church.\nThe Instructions said the infiltration will take perhaps not one year, perhaps not ten years, but perhaps a century.\nThe Carbonari must enter into the seminary, into the convent, into the sacristy, and slowly, very slowly, the priests will have the ideals of the revolution; of the Freemasons.\nOne day these priests, imbued with Masonic principles, will become bishops, and these bishops can then choose a pope.\nAnd even if the pope is not a Freemason, he will have the same ideals as the Freemasons.\nPope Pius IX called for the publishing of these Instructions in order to warn the bishops and priests of those times of the fight against the church.\nIn 1895, the Catholic Antonia Fogazzaro, a known modernist, founded a masonic lodge in Milan.\nHe wrote in his book, Il Santo, that “We [modernists]…want a reform in the Church…without rebellion, carried out by legitimate authority…even if this takes 20, 30, or 50 years.”[4] “The reform will have to be brought about in the name of obedience.” The modernist ideas in the Church introduced and enacted through obedience!\nAnd I think…well, here we are!\nIn this time!\nThe reform is here, and it is brought about through obedience, to the Council, to the bishop, to the priest.\nAnd all they say is “Obedience, obedience, obedience.”\nThe Instructions of the Carbonari say the bishop and the priest will think that they are following the tiara of the Pope, but they will be following the flag of Freemasonry [“the banner of revolution”].\nThey said that.\nThey wrote that!\nOne century before [the Council]!\nThus, it is very important to know that they prepared for the beginning of the Second Vatican Council for a century, perhaps two centuries!\nAs the Archbishop of Dakar and President of the Episcopal Commission for French-speaking West Africa, I was appointed member of the Central Preparatory Commission of the Second Vatican Council.\nThere were some seventy cardinals, twenty bishops, and four super-authorities of the religious orders, among others.\nBefore the last meeting of this Commission the members received two schemas on the same subject: one from Cardinal Ottaviani and another from Cardinal Bea.\nThe schema from Cardinal Ottaviani was titled “…On Religious Tolerance” and the other, from Cardinal Bea, was titled “On Religious Freedom [Liberty].” When we read these two schemas, we thought, “This is impossible.\nHow is it we can receive two opposing theses?\nOne says we must not tolerate error.\nThe other says that error has the right to exist in the name of the dignity of the human person.” And so, we go into the meeting.\nCardinal Ottaviani, standing, says to Cardinal Bea, “You have no authority to compose this schema, because it is a theological thesis and therefore within the competence of the Theological Commission.” As Cardinal Bea stands up, he says, “I do have the right to compose this schema because if anything concerns Christian Unity it is religious liberty, and I am the President of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity.” Cardinal Bea, addressing Cardinal Ottaviani, further said, “I am opposed to your schema.”\nImpossible!\nWe were in a very sad, serious situation.\nCardinal Ruffini had to intervene as we were in front of two cardinals, our brothers.\nHe said we must wait for the authority to say who is right and who is wrong.\nBut before the Pope came (because the Pope came many times to present at these meetings) we voted on the schema.\nWho is with Cardinal Ottaviani?\nWho is with Cardinal Bea?\nThe conservatives and the liberals.\nAs the last meeting of the Preparatory Commission, it was for me the first image of the future Council.\nThis historic address appeared for the first time ever in a print edition of The Remnant last year.\nIsn't it time for you to subscribe?\nAnd as we go into the Council, you know that on the first day of the Council, Cardinal Lienart was the chief of the liberal cardinals in the Council, [together] with all of the Cardinals of the Rhine (such as Cardinal Alfrink, Cardinal Frings, Cardinal Dopfner, Cardinal Suenens, Cardinal Leinart, and Cardinal Koenig of Austria).\nAnd now one month ago in Rome, the traditional periodical Chiesa Viva published a photo of Cardinal Lienart with all of the appurtenances of Freemasonry, the date of his inscription in Masonry, the date [of his rising to] the 20th Degree of Freemasonry, the date [of his rising to] the 30th Degree of Freemasonry, and the places where he [attended] the meetings of Freemasonry.\nThis Cardinal was the chief of the liberals in the Council.\nThat is my cardinal; he ordained me to the priesthood, and he consecrated me a bishop.\nAnd now this is public.\nNobody has been able to refute the publication.\nAnd so, we have (I am confident) a mutation in the church by the Council and by the reform after the Council.\nNow, some say the Council is (was) good, but only the reforms were bad.\nThat is not true.\nWhy?\nBecause when the reforms come, Rome always says the reforms are being done in the name of the Council.\nIn the name of the Council!\nIt is evident that all of the reforms came from the Council.\nAnd if the reforms are bad, then it is impossible that the Council is good and all the reforms are bad, because that is the authentic interpretation of the Council by Rome.\nRome said in the name of the Declaration of Liturgy, we [implement] the liturgical reform.\nWe can say that [these bad changes are] not in the text of the Declaration, but this man has the authority to say that this is from the Council.\nThey know that.\nAnd I am sure that it [the mutation] is in the Council.\nEven if it is not explicitly [stated] in the Council but [rather] in the spirit of the Council, it is the same!\nFor example, with religious freedom: now the Holy See and all the Nuncios are against the Catholic State in the name of the Council - in the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom.\nI have heard this (personally) twice.\nThe first time I was in Columbia.\nWhen I was in Columbia, I read in the paper about the change in the first article of the Constitution of the Republic of Columbia.\n[The first article] stated that only the Republic of Columbia recognizes only the Catholic religion.\nThey changed it.\nThey removed this article.\nI read the discourse of the President of Columbia with the Nuncios of Columbia and the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference in Columbia.\nThe President said he is very, very anxious.\nHe said to the people, “even though we remove this article we remain Catholic.\nI am a Catholic, I shall remain Catholic, and I do everything possible for the Council and the Catholics in our country.”\nThen, the discourse of the Nuncio was the discourse of a Freemason: all of it was “progress,” “humanity,” “evolution,” and all the hubris of a Freemason.\nAnd during the discourse of the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference, [the Secretary] said, “in the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom [of Vatican II], we ask the President to remove this article in the Constitution.”\nI met this Secretary of the Episcopal Conference during my visit in Columbia, and he said for two years they [had been asking] the President, in the name of the Holy See, to change this article in their Constitution.\nBut I will never…I do not accept the concept, because you destroy the Catholic State in the name of the Council.\nAre you sure?\nYes, sure.\nIt is evident.\nNow I said to the [Secretary], “As I speak with you now about Columbia, I know that you are the one responsible for the change in the constitution of Valais in Switzerland one year ago.\nThe change in the Constitution of Valais was the same.” (Because you know Switzerland is a Federation where some states are Protestant and some states are Catholic.\nThe Valais is Catholic.\nAnd in its constitution, the words of the first article [of the constitution] of the State of Valais – Econe, where we are located, is in the State of Valais - only one religion is recognized: The Catholic Church.)\nAnd [the Secretary] said, “Yes, I am responsible for this change.” Brother, what did you do with the Social Kingship of Christ?\nWhat is this for you?\nWhat do you say when you say “thy kingdom come” in your prayer, the Our Father?\n“Ah,” the Nuncio said to me, “Now it is impossible.” What did you do with the encyclical of Pope Pius XI, Quas Primas?\n“Ah, but now the Pope cannot write an encyclical like Quas Primas.”\nIt is incredible.\nAnd all in the name of the Council.\nWe must take care, because this change in the church is a liberal change.\nThe liberal principles have entered the Church now, and they destroy the Church.\nIf we cannot set out the true principles of the Church, if we in the name of religious freedom said that all religions have the same right in every state in the world…\n[missing audio...]\nThe truth is the only one King of the World is Jesus Christ.\nWe say in the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, “Tu solus Altissimus,” “Tu solus Dominus,” “You alone are the Highest,” “You alone are the Lord.” But practically, we would refuse this Kingdom of Jesus Christ if we said that Luther, Mohammed, Buddha and Jesus Christ are all the same.\nWe cannot say that.\nImpossible.\nWe know that in many states (it is a pity) it is impossible [to recognize Catholicism as the state religion].\nWe must tolerate - have tolerance for the error - but never give the same right to error and truth.\nThat is impossible.\nAnd the change in the liturgy is very important.\nIt is very bad.\nOne of the principles of modern man, as they say now, “modern man,” is democracy.\nAnd democracy can have a good sense but not if [by that term is meant] that those who govern receive their authority from the people.\nThe authority comes from God.\nNot from the people.\nNot from the masses.\nFrom God.\nBut today the principle, the democratic principle, is that the authority is in the people.\nIt is in the masses.\nThat is not true.\nIt is impossible.\nAnd our liturgy is the school of our Faith.\nIt is the first school of our Faith for all people.\nI was in Africa as a missionary and as bishop for 30 years.\nI know the liturgy was the best school of the Faith for people who cannot read.\nThey can see what the priest does.\nThey can see what the priest does at the adoration of the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ.\nAnd they know that Jesus Christ is present - His real presence is on the altar - by the attitude of the priest.\nThey know that.\nThat is very important.\nBut the change in the Mass destroys the Church.\nBecause we know the liturgy teaches us hierarchy.\nThe true liturgy is hierarchical.\nIt is not democratic but hierarchical.\nWhy?\nBecause we have God, the priest, and then the people.\nThat is hierarchy.\nWhen we are in Church we know God is on the altar; the priest is between God and the people; and the people receive God at the hand of the priest.\nThat is hierarchy.\nBut now the new liturgy is more democratic - all around the table.\nThe priest is only the president, and sometimes another man can take the role of the president of the meal.\nThat is a new liturgy.\nThat is very bad, because we have no sense of the hierarchical; whereas the sense of hierarchy is very important in our life.\nWe need the authority of God.\nWe need the Real Presence of God on our altar.\nWe need the Sacrifice of the Mass – not a meal only – but the Sacrifice.\nSo, the Victim of the Sacrifice is really present on our altar.\nThat is the school of our Faith.\nAnd slowly, slowly, this new Mass equivocates.\nIt moves the minds of the faithful in a Protestant [direction].\nI do not say that all [Novus Ordo] Masses are invalid.\nI do not say that.\nBut perhaps, more and more, they become invalid because [the ministers lose faith in the Real Presence].\nRecently, in France, a progressive paper conducted a statistical survey to see how many priests no longer have faith in the Real Presence.\nThey found that twenty-two percent no longer have the faith, the belief in the Real Presence.\nBut I think that if they directed this question to all of the priests who are under 50 years of age, they would find that fifty percent [have lost the faith in the Real Presence], because the young priests have no faith.\nNo faith.\nLast year, Bishop Adam (in our Diocese of Sion, Switzerland) ordained one priest for my Congregation of the Holy Ghost Fathers.\nThis one priest came from France.\nHis uncle had died in a road accident when his cab fell in the river.\nThe uncle had nine children.\nThe Bishop said to the new priest, “Now you can say Mass for your uncle.\nNow you are a priest, and you can say Mass for your uncle.” The new priest said, “No, never.” Why?\nIt is not useful to say Mass for the dead?\n“No, no, it is impossible.\nThey are already in heaven.” This young priest who was ordained by the Bishop last year for my Congregation is now a professor in the minor seminary in Switzerland.\nThey are not learning theology, not philosophy, not anything.\nThey learn nothing now.\nAnother example.\nRecently, I had two young [potential] seminarians come to my house near Paris.\nOne of them works in a factory, and the other is a university student.\nThey told me they were [considering] the seminary of Paris.\nI asked them, “Why do you come to see me?” They told me that they had a meeting in the house of the Oblate of Maria with the priest who oversees young men who may have vocations to the priesthood in the Diocese of Paris.\nThere was a total of fifteen young men for all of the Diocese of Paris.\nDuring the meeting, the priest, before he celebrated the Eucharist, said, “Today we celebrate the Eucharist, but we do not believe in the Real Presence.” These two young men said “That is impossible.\nWe cannot remain in this seminary.” So, they came to meet me.\nThey said that Econe is the only seminary where they seem to be able to find the True Faith.\nThey asked for admittance to Econe.\nAnd I think that they shall be coming to Econe next October.\nBut that is a new religion.\nIt is a Protestant religion.\nThat is a fact.\nPerhaps you can say, “How is it possible that the pope gives the authorization to this change?\nHow is it possible the pope signed this decree?\nSigned this constitution?” I don’t know.\nI don’t know.\nIt is a big mystery.\nA big mystery.\nThere are many proposed theological answers.\nI cannot subscribe to all of them.\nSome say the pope is not responsible.\nPerhaps someone gave the pope an injection, a drug, and he is not responsible.\nPerhaps, I don’t know.\nSome say there are two popes [(a body double)].\nI don’t know.\nSome say the pope was liberal before he was elected pope, and perhaps (we do not know) he gave his name to Freemasonry (thereby incurring excommunication before the conclave).\nWe do not know.\nWe do know now that Bugnini was primarily responsible for the change in liturgy, and that he is an infamous Freemason.\nAnd because he had an indiscretion with his Masonic appurtenances, the Pope sent him as a Nuncio in Iran.\nI don’t know.\nWe don’t know.\nNow, you cannot say that Archbishop Lefebvre said the pope gave his name to Freemasonry.\nNo, you cannot say that.\nIt is possible, but we do not know.\nBut if he was excommunicated, then he is not pope.\nNot pope.\nIllegitimate.\nI don’t know.\nIt is a mystery I cannot understand.\nBut the fact is that the Catholic Church is being destroyed, and now even the pope himself says that.\nThis pope has referred to the auto-demolition of the Church.\nHe said, “The smoke of Satan has entered the Church.” But where are the men responsible for the destruction of the Church?\nWell, there they are.\nThey are the men who destroy the Church.\nWe must show where they are.\nWhere is this smoke of Satan that has entered the Church?\nI do not know, but it is the pope himself who said that.\nAnd I have these experiences every day.\nI visit many countries.\nI was in Spain during the Christmas Holy Days.\nThen I was in Bonn, near Cologne, Germany, three weeks ago, to speak at a conference.\nMany people came.\nMany people are confused.\nWhat is happening in the Church?\nThey are anxious.\nBut many people say that we disobey.\nDisobey?\nObedience is relative.\nIt is not absolute.\nIt is relative to the good, but not to the evil.\nWe cannot obey our parents if they command a bad thing.\nWe cannot obey.\nIt is clear.\nAnd I know that in Spain, for example, the situation in the Church is very bad.\nThe new nominees of bishops and many auxiliary bishops are, approximately, communist, Marxist, and socialist.\nAnd so, a majority of the bishops in the Episcopal Conference of Spain are progressives.\nThey are modernists.\nWhereas, the majority of the bishops [from Spain] during the Council were conservative.\nSo, Rome is responsible [for the situation of the Church in Spain] because it is Rome who approves the nominations for bishops.\nAnd we know in France, in Germany, and in Europe generally, that all of the young bishops are worse [than the bishops in Spain] in that they are more or less Marxist.\nThat is a fact.\nThat is impossible.\nHow can they do that?\nI do not know.\nI do not know.\nI have not spent my whole life in Rome.\nI do know Rome very well, because I was an apostolic delegate, and I was in the Secretariate of the Secretary of State.\nAnd I know that very well.\nBut I think that the devil is in Rome, as was said by our Lady of Fatima and Our Lady of La Salette.\nWe must pray.\nWe must ask God to put an end to this crisis of the Church.\nBecause if this crisis continues, many people will go to hell.\nThey lose the faith.\nThey cannot go into the church.\nThey abandon the faith.\nYou know that many priests have abandoned the faith.\nMany priests have gotten married.\nAnd many sisters have abandoned their congregations.\nIt is a pity.\nAnd it is everywhere.\nI was in Melbourne, Australia, during the 40th International Eucharistic Congress.\nCardinal Knox, who was the man responsible for the Eucharistic Congress, is now the Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship.\nI read in the newspaper about a Mass Cardinal Knox celebrated during the Eucharistic Congress where sensual dancing was performed at the same time the words of the Consecration were pronounced.\nThat is a sacrilege.\nYou cannot go to that Mass.\nThat is sacrilege.\nThis is a fact.\nThey also called me by phone in Melbourne to say I was on the list of the bishops [attending] the Eucharistic Congress.\nThey asked me to concelebrate Mass with a Protestant pastor and a rabbi.\nAy.\nImpossible.\nImpossible.\nNo, no, no, no.\n[applause]\nThis change is not accidental.\nIt is not superficial.\nIt is very deep.\nVery bad.\nIt is against our faith.\nAgainst our faith.\nAnd so, we cannot accept this Council and this reform and this orientation even though it comes from Rome.\nFrom Rome we expect only the good.\nWe do not expect the bad, the ill. We do not expect the abandonment of adoration in the Mass.\nWe need this adoration.\nWe need to have the faith in the divinity of Jesus Christ.\nBecause all [of this change] is [oriented] against the divinity of Jesus Christ, against the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, against the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Mass.\nIt is a sin when we abandon the truth of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, everywhere, and we abandon the Faith of the divinity of Jesus Christ.\nHe is King because he is God.\nHe is the Son of God.\nSo, He is King by His nature.\nThis is essential.\nEssential!\nAnd if He is God, we must give Him the adoration of God.\nAnd so, we cannot accept the diminution of this Truth.\nJesus Christ is the Son of God.\nJesus Christ is God.\nThat is a fundamental truth of our Faith.\nAnd it all depends on this Truth.\nAnd we know now that the theologians and the bishops have [a new orientation].\nThey do not express this truth clearly and perfectly.\nThey are afraid of the truth.\nThat is very bad.\nAnd it is the same in Rome.\nI think they refuse [to grant me an audience with] the pope, [because they are afraid of the Truth].\nWhen I was in Rome one month ago, Mgr.\nBenelli told me he visits the pope every day.\nHe said that when he left me, he would go immediately to the pope to express the importance of the work we had conducted during our meeting.\nImmediately, he said, he would be going.\nSo, why do they not grant me the possibility of visiting the pope?\nBecause they are afraid.\nMeanwhile the Vatican operated a veritable swinging door where actual heretics and schismatics were concerned.\nHere, again, is Blessed Paul VI, famously meeting for the first time ever with the heretic Archbishop of Canterbury in St. Peter's:\nCardinal Villot said, “We are afraid if Msgr.\nLefebvre meets and speaks with the pope that perhaps the pope will change his mind.” Because [the pope] is not too sure; the pope is not man of true conviction.\nHe is a mysterious man.\nWe cannot give a definition of the man.\nHe expresses the truth, and then he does the contrary\/opposite.\nSome part of him will speak the truth.\nAnother part of him is open to error.\nVery curious.\nAnd they are afraid that if I reveal the truth [and tell the Pope] “you must affirm the Kingdom of Jesus Christ everywhere and always each day.\nYou must affirm the Real Presence in the Mass - in the Sacrifice of the Mass,” then perhaps it is possible that the Pope will change his mind.\nAnd so, Cardinal Villot says, there is a confusion, and they do not want me to visit the pope.\nIt is impossible to admit me.\nAnd I know the pope very well!\nWhen I was the apostolic delegate to Pius XII, I was going to Rome every year.\nAnd during those eleven years, I met Msgr.\nMontini.\nI know him very well.\nHe received me twice during the Council, for a private audience with the pope.\nBut, now, with my position against the Council and the reforms, he says: “No, impossible!\nYou must sign in writing that you [accept] the Council and all the reforms before I will receive you in audience.” But I cannot do that.\nFor me, if I do that, then I betray my mother, the Church.\nThe Church!\nSo, I thank you very much for your encouragement, and I must say that we have a very good generation of young men and good vocations.\nFor the coming year we have 59 applications to our seminary in Econe, Switzerland – applications from the United States, from England, from Germany, from France, and Spain.\nGood young men with good dispositions are coming from everywhere.\nAnd why?\nWhy do they come to this seminary when they know we are in difficulties with Rome?\nThey know that.\nBut still they come.\nI ask them, why do you come to Econe?\nYou know our situation.\nThey say, “Yes, we know your situation, but we want to become true priests and not protestant pastors or modernist priests.\nWe are coming to your seminary because we know that the end of the priest is to offer the true Sacrifice of the Mass.\nAnd so, we are Coming to Econe.”\nAnd as I have visited my seminary here in Armada for the past five days, I can see it is the same here.\nWe have very good young men.\nI also have some Americans in my seminary in Econe.\nIn six weeks I will ordain one American priest from Detroit, who is a very good seminarian and will be a good priest.\nBut these young men refuse to become protestants.\nThey refuse to become modernist.\nThey ask to become true priests.\nAnd it is a pity there are not 100 bishops opening good seminaries.\nSo, I ask you to pray for these seminarians because when they become priests they will have many worries and many difficulties.\nI think, however, they are very well prepared to deal with these difficulties and worries.\nAnd we have confidence in God.\nSince I began this work six years ago, now, I have evidence that God is assisting us.\nBecause it is impossible, I realize, to do this by myself.\nWe now have houses in Switzerland (3), Munich, France (6), Brussels (1), England, Armada, San Francisco, and New York.\nIn Albano, near Rome, we have a congregation of sisters where I have five vocations from the states (good sisters).\nAnd I am building a seminary in Switzerland.\nIt is impossible to do all this without God’s assistance.\nSo, I have confidence.\nIt is impossible for the Church to change its tradition.\nThe tradition of twenty centuries.\nThat we cannot change.\nThe Church is tradition.\nThe Church is tradition.\nIt is not revolution.\nI thank you for your attention.\nNOTES:\n[1] Archbishop Benelli, who had the title of “Substitute” (meaning the Assistant to the Secretary of State) of the Vatican Secretariat of State, later created Cardinal and appointed Archbishop of Florence

Association (AMA) should seriously consider changing their names since they are about as anti-American as it comes in their new demands for gun confiscation measures, which include guns and ammunition confiscation, as well as universal gun registration.\nThe AMA, which should take no political position when it comes to guns, except to uphold the law which protects the God-given rights of law-abiding citizens, came out with a lengthy blog post not only calling for guns and ammunition confiscation, as well as universal gun registration but also proposals to ban the sale and possession of “all assault-type weapons, bump stocks and related devices, high-capacity magazines, and armor piercing bullets.”\nNow, the majority of people at the AMA probably couldn't tell you any of these

shooters, right?\nWrong.\nYeah, that's gonna keep people safe.\nIt's going to infringe on the rights of those who don't commit crimes and need a gun to protect themselves or be part of the constitutional militia.\nThe AMA also wants to bypass the Fifth Amendment protections concerning someone actually being indicted and found guilty of a crime being deprived of their liberty and property as they promote a new legal procedure by which “family members, intimate partners, household members and law enforcement personnel” can petition courts to confiscate firearms from people “when there is a high or imminent risk for violence.”\nThey want to do what President Donald Trump suggested and \"take the guns first\" and forget due process.\nSee?\nThis is why they should be

domestic violence restraining orders to include dating partners.\nRequiring states to have protocols or processes in place for requiring the removal of firearms by prohibited persons.\nRequiring domestic violence restraining orders and gun violence restraining orders to be entered into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\nEfforts to ensure the public is aware of the existence of laws that allow for the removal of firearms from high-risk individuals.\nThe delegates also modified existing policy to: Recognize the role of firearms in suicides.\nEncourage the development of curricula and training for physicians with a focus on suicide risk assessment and prevention as well as lethal means safety counseling.\nEncourage physicians, as a part of their suicide prevention strategy, to discuss lethal means safety and work with families to reduce access to lethal means of suicide.\nNewly adopted policy also means the AMA will:\nAdvocate for schools to remain gun-free zones except for school-sanctioned activities and professional law enforcement officials.\nOppose requirements or incentives of teachers to carry weapons.\nThey also oppose concealed carry reciprocity, which I do as well, but based on the principle that the Second Amendment's protections extend to the various states as well, since it recognizes a right, not a permission, to keep and

{"prompt":"Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here's the story behind her killing\n\nThe surprise acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate in the shooting death of San Francisco woman Kate Steinle set off a firestorm of outrage Thursday night, as top conservatives and critics of so-called \"sanctuary cities\" pinned blame for Steinle's death on illegal immigration and insufficiently aggressive deportation policies.\n\nGarcia Zarate, a 45-year-old Mexican national who was homeless and living in the US illegally when he fired the shot that killed Steinle, was acquitted by a jury on murder and manslaughter charges.\nThe jury convicted him of the lesser charge of being a felon in possession of a gun, which carries a maximum sentence of three years in state prison.\n\nSteinle, 32, was fatally shot while she walked along Pier 14 of the San Francisco Bay with her father in July 2015.\nThe bullet that pierced her back had ricocheted off the concrete ground after it was fired by Garcia Zarate from a handgun belonging to a federal ranger that had been stolen four days earlier.\n\nGarcia Zarate's defense attorneys argued that the shooting was an accident — they said he found the gun wrapped in a T-shirt or cloth under a pier bench and unintentionally discharged it.\nLead attorney Matt Gonzalez has argued that the weapon was a SIG Sauer with a \"hair trigger in single-action mode\" — a model well-known for accidental discharges even among experienced shooters.\nGonzalez told the jury, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, that Garcia Zarate had never handled a firearm before, was frightened by the noise of the gunshot, then flung the weapon into the bay where it was later found by a diver.\n\nProsecutors, however, alleged that Garcia Zarate brought the weapon to the pier deliberately to do harm, and intentionally aimed and shot Steinle after firmly pulling the trigger.\nThey said Garcia Zarate then threw the weapon into the bay and fled the scene.\n\nBeyond the shooting itself, perhaps the most controversial aspect of Garcia Zarate's case involves his previous criminal activity and history of deportations, and how San Francisco and federal authorities handled his custody before he ever picked up the gun and shot Steinle.\nAt the time of Steinle's death, Garcia Zarate had been convicted of nonviolent drug crimes and deported five times since the early 1990s.\n\nHe faced a sixth deportation in 2015, and was in Justice Department (DOJ) custody that March after serving 46 months in prison for a felony re-entry into the US, but instead of transferring him into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deportation, the department transferred him to the San Francisco County Jail for prosecution of a 1995 marijuana charge.\n\nSan Francisco prosecutors, who had long ago deprioritized marijuana charges, dismissed the decades-old charge and released Garcia Zarate on April 15, 2015.\nDue to San Francisco's policy of limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities — which some refer to as a \"sanctuary\" policy — the city did not inform ICE when they released Garcia Zarate.\n\nAs a result of the case, both the DOJ and the city of San Francisco have changed several policies.\nThe DOJ announced in 2016 it would no longer release potentially deportable detainees to local jails without first allowing ICE to take custody.\nSan Francisco, meanwhile, has adjusted its policy to notify ICE if they are releasing suspected undocumented immigrants who face charges of serious or violent felonies.\n\n\"This tragedy could have been prevented if San Francisco had simply turned the alien over to ICE as we requested, instead of releasing him back onto the streets,\" ICE Director Thomas Homan said in a statement on Thursday.\n\"It is unconscionable that politicians across this country continue to endanger the lives of Americans with sanctuary policies while ignoring the harm inflicted on their constituents.\"\n\nBut ICE has faced criticism of its own over not seeking a judicial warrant to legally obtain custody of Garcia Zarate when it discovered he had been transferred into San Francisco's custody.\nThe agency has argued that obtaining judicial warrants are unnecessary and would place too much burden on ICE officials and federal courts.\n\nThough the agency did issue a request to the city to detain Garcia Zarate until ICE officials could pick him up, their detainer requests are not signed by a judge and are therefore not legally binding.\nSan Francisco's policy is to ignore such requests if they are not accompanied by judge-signed warrants, and the city has cited federal court cases concluding that such detentions violate inmates' Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nGarcia Zarate's deportation and criminal history made him an effective target for immigration hardliners, who argued that Steinle would still be alive were it not for an insecure border and lenient treatment toward suspected undocumented immigrants in local jails.\nPresident Donald Trump immediately seized on the verdict on Thursday as evidence of the perils of \"Illegal Immigration.\"\nTrump frequently villainized Garcia Zarate and cited Steinle's death during his presidential campaign, using the case to bolster his argument for a border wall and aid his crusade against \"sanctuary cities.\"\n\nEarly on Friday, Trump also falsely claimed on Twitter that Garcia Zarate had previously committed violent crimes and had illegally entered the US six times due to lax border security under the Obama administration.\n\n\"The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court.\nHis exoneration is a complete travesty of justice.\nBUILD THE WALL!\"\nTrump tweeted.\n\nIn fact, Garcia Zarate had never been convicted of a violent crime before Steinle's shooting — his previous convictions were for nonviolent drug crimes and illegal entry.\nLax border security, too, does not appear to be a factor since Garcia Zarate was caught by border patrol agents each time he entered the country under the Obama administration.\n\nIn contrast, Steinle's family has expressed nuanced views on immigration and \"sanctuary\" policies.\nThey have both condemned Trump for \"sensationalizing\" Steinle's death to advance anti-immigration policies, and expressed frustration with San Francisco officials, who they believe went too far in refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"The Plague Is AIRBORNE And It’s Spreading Because People Are Literally ‘Dancing With Corpses’\n\nThe plague that’s airborne and has killed at least 124 people in Madagascar is now blamed on “dancing with corpses.” This is the time of year when the dead are wrapped in sheets and paraded through the streets while others dance around the bodies.\nThe local tradition is said to be one of the major causes of the spread of this disease.\nSince it’s airborne, anyone coming close to the corpse of a person who has died of the black death could themselves, catch the infection.\nHealth officials suspect it’s no coincidence that the outbreak coincides with the time of year when families customarily exhume the remains of dead relatives, wrap them in a sheet, and dance with them through the streets in a sacred ritual, AFP reports.\n“If a person dies of pneumonic plague and is then interred in a tomb that is subsequently opened for [the ritual], the bacteria can still be transmitted and contaminate whoever handles the body,” said Willy Randriamarotia, Madagascar’s health ministry chief of staff.\nSome locals believe the whole plague is some kind of a government conspiracy, and say they have no intention of forgoing the ritual known as “famadihana.” They say they will continue to dance with the dead and intend to honor their ancestors.\n“I will always practice the turning of the bones of my ancestors — plague or no plague.\nThe plague is a lie,” Helene Raveloharisoa told the wire service.\nJosephine Ralisiarisoa firmly believes the country’s cash-strapped government is just exaggerating the problem to get money ahead of an election next year.\nAnd it isn’t that anyone is putting this past a government to lie for profits, but health officials have even warned tourists, a source of money, to stay away from Madagascar for their own health.\n“I have participated in at least 15 famadihana ceremonies in my life.\nAnd I’ve never caught the plague,” she told the AFP.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|50|93\nLoaded_Language|189|211\nAppeal_to_Authority|363|376\nAppeal_to_Authority|1092|1168\nCausal_Oversimplification|343|430\nCausal_Oversimplification|570|727\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1423|1442\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1556|1599\nDoubt|1556|1643\nDoubt|1649|1722\nDoubt|1112|1168\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|939|1017\nName_Calling,Labeling|1542|1555."}
{"prompt":"FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base\n\n“Motive a mystery in car explosion at Travis Air Force Base” was the Los Angeles Times headline, and this one is indeed a real mystery.\nA Muslim named Hafiz Kazi, according to the Times, “drove a burning minivan filled with propane and gas tanks into the front gate of Travis Air Force Base in Northern California.” After scrutinizing all the evidence closely, the FBI just can’t figure out what could possibly have been Kazi’s motive.\nAnd that in a nutshell shows what’s wrong with today’s FBI.\nSean Ragan, FBI special agent in charge of the Sacramento field office, stated: “We don’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point.\nNow the question is, why.\nWhy was he there?\nWhat led him there?\nAnd we don’t know answers to that, quite frankly.”\nThe Times noted that when emergency responders approached the burning van after it crashed, “they found five propane tanks, three plastic one-gallon gas cans, several lighters, three phones and a gym bag with personal items, Ragan said.”\nYes, what Kazi could possibly have been up to is a complete mystery.\nThe Times added that “the dead man’s religious beliefs and affiliation are not known at this point, said Ragan, who debunked a rumor that some sort of ‘jihad’ video was found on Kazi’s phone.”\nAll right.\nNo jihad video.\nAnd no “nexus of terrorism,” according to Sean Ragan.\nWhat is a nexus of terrorism?\nRagan most likely means that investigators didn’t find an ISIS membership card in Kazi’s wallet, or lots of phone calls to Iraq or Syria, or a note from Kazi reading, “I did this for Allah and Islam.\nAllahu akbar.”\nOf course, even if they had found those things, given the FBI’s recent track record of denial and deception, they may still be searching for Kazi’s motive.\nIn any case, a larger point is being lost here.\nAnd that is that there is a war going on.\nWe know that the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and other groups have called upon Muslims in the U.S. to try to kill military personnel and police, as well as civilians.\nWe know that Kazi, with all the propane and gas tanks in his car, was clearly trying to set off a major fire that would kill more people than just himself.\nEven if he wasn’t on the phone to Baghdadi, the likelihood is that when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad.\nThe FBI’s bafflement here is part of its deep, deep corruption.\nThe FBI doesn’t acknowledge that there is a global jihad, or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism.\nIt doesn’t admit that there is a war going on, and treats each act of Islamic terror as if it were a separate and discrete criminal event, unrelated to all the others.\nSo each time something like this happens, they’re back at Square One, trying to figure out motive.\nIt’s as if the U.S. Army stopped to interrogate every German soldier who crashed through the Ardennes Forest at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, to see if each one’s actions had anything to do with the German Army and Adolf Hitler’s war aims.\nAuthorities are also investigating whether or not Kazi was suffering from any mental health issues.\nHere again, this is just more of the general refusal to acknowledge the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the living room and screaming “Allahu akbar.” Sean Ragan might explain to us that authorities are also trying to determine whether the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 was motivated by Nazism, or by mental health issues among the German High Command.\nThis willful ignorance leads to a diversion and waste of resources that is astronomical and catastrophic.\nHow long is this comic opera going to continue?\nIf the jihadis advance even into the FBI’s Sacramento offices, will agents there be struggling to determine the jihadis’ motive even as the machete begins to slice through their necks?\nRobert Spencer is the director of Jihad Watch and author of the New York Times bestsellers The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) and The Truth About Muhammad.\nHis new book is Confessions of an Islamophobe.\nFollow him on Twitter here.\nLike him on Facebook here.\n>","completion":" Bandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|3083|3111\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|3460|3527\nLoaded_Language|1641|1653\nCausal_Oversimplification|2426|2763\nDoubt|2765|2862\nCausal_Oversimplification|1441|1653\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1902|2063\nLoaded_Language|3292|3313\nLoaded_Language|3345|3354\nSlogans|3356|3368\nLoaded_Language|3662|3691\nLoaded_Language|3877|3924."}
{"prompt":"Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government\n\nThe McGill student at the centre of anti-Semitic allegations says he’s certain the climate within student government will improve, after a report into the incident was made public this week.\nNoah Lew and two other students were voted off the Students’ Society of McGill University last October after they were identified as having pro-Israel viewpoints.\nThey were since reinstated.\nA report made public this week by Spencer Boudreau concluded he could not determine if students who organized against the three board members had anti-Semitic intentions.\nBoudreau, a retired professor of education and former ombudsperson for students, however, said he understood why the students felt they were targeted because they are Jewish.\nAfter criticism from several Jewish groups both on and off campus, Boudreau issued a clarification to the report, saying he could not determine if the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism, but he acknowledged there were “in fact anti-Semitic effects felt by members of the Jewish community.”\nSpeaking to the Montreal Gazette on Friday, Lew, the SSMU’s vice-president of finance for the Arts, said he was initially upset with the report, but felt vindicated by Boudreau’s clarification.\n“I thought this acknowledgement was very important and I really did appreciate that he clarified the matter,” he said.\nJewish groups had criticized Boudreau’s report, saying it ignored anti-Semitic language used on Facebook by a group called Democratize SSMU.\nThe group was urging students to vote against Lew, and two other board members who were deemed to be pro-Israel, alleging “layers of corruption” within the student government and favouritism in appointing board members, then singled out three members of the board “who are all either fellows at the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee, an organization whose explicit mandate is to promote pro-Israel discourse in Canadian politics, or primary organizers for the anti-BDS initiative at McGill.”\nBoudreau made his clarification after it was pointed out the anti-Semitic language was published prior to the vote.\nWhile Democratize SSMU later apologized for the language and deleted it from its site, the damage had already been done, Boudreau concluded.\nLew said he feels vindicated to some extent, but is concerned anti-Semitism is still a problem within student government.\n“There have been some steps taken by the administration and the student body in the right direction, but it’s certainly not over,” he said.\nIn the months leading up to the vote, there had been other anti-Semitic incidents, including a tweet by Igor Sadikov, an elected representative of students in McGill’s faculty of arts, saying: “punch a zionist.”\nAmong the measures taken by SSMU after the October vote was the creation of a committee looking into the issue of anti-Semitism within the student government, which Lew sits on.\nOn Wednesday, McGill Principal Suzanne Fortier said the University wants to ensure a safe space for all students.\n“I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that there is absolutely no place for anti-Semitism at McGill University and that, as principal and vice-chancellor, I will remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe, welcomed and respected on our campuses.”\nIn addition to ordering the report, Fortier set up a hotline to report incidents of of intolerance and a task force to investigate incidents of academic freedom and equity.\nRabbi Reuben Poupko, the co-chair for Quebec of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, said it should be noted McGill in general is a safe space for Jewish students.\nHowever, he said any Jewish students thinking of being involved in student politics or activism “will have encounters that are profoundly disturbing and unpleasant.”\nHe said McGill is not alone in this respect, as this is a continent-wide phenomenon within student politics.\nDemocratize SSMU did not respond to a request for an interview.\nRelated\njmagder@postmedia.com\nTwitter.com\/JasonMagder\nFacebook.com\/JasonMagderJournalist\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|1668|1688\nDoubt|1658|1763\nSlogans|2760|2775\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3131|3159\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|3704|3867\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|3870|3977."}

{"prompt":"Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer\n\nThis article was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge\nUpdate 2 : Just as we suspected, President Trump has tweeted his opinion on this decision…\nA disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case!\nNo wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 1, 2017\nUpdate 1: AP reports that U.S. immigration officials say they will deport the Mexican man found not guilty of murder in San Francisco pier shooting.\n* * *\nAs we detailed earlier, in a verdict that has shocked many in the Bay Area (and across America), a jury of six men and six women in sanctuary city San Francisco found illegal immigrant (and five-time deportee) Jose Ines Garcia Zarate not guilty in the death of Kate Steinle.\nMr. Garcia Zarate had been homeless at the time of the shooting and had multiple felony convictions and five prior deportations to Mexico.\nHe had been set free from jail only months before the shooting, in defiance of requests by federal immigration authorities, who had asked that he be held longer so he could be deported again.\nThe backlash to his release into the community crescendoed when Donald Trump invoked Ms. Steinle’s killing as he campaigned for president.\nAs The New York Times reports, Ms. Steinle’s death in July 2015 fed into a fierce debate over whether immigrants without legal status should be deported more aggressively, and over the role local law enforcement should play.\nMs. Steinle, known as Kate, a 32-year-old medical equipment saleswoman, was walking along Pier 14 in San Francisco when she was struck by a bullet and collapsed into her father’s arms.\nMr. Garcia Zarate acknowledged firing the weapon, but said it was an accident.\nZarate and his defense team maintained the argument that the suspect found the stolen weapon on the pier that day and it “just fired.” The gun belonged to a federal Bureau of Land Management ranger and was stolen from his parked car a week earlier.\nThe bullet ricocheted on the pier’s concrete walkway before it struck Steinle, killing her.\nZarate has admitted to shooting Steinle, but says it was an accident.\nDefense attorney Matt Gonzalez said Garcia Zarate found the gun at the pier… but the stories of what happened copntradicted one another…\nHe said it was wrapped in cloth, and when Garcia Zarate unwrapped it, the gun accidentally discharged.\nBut in a police interrogation, Garcia Zarate admitted to firing the gun, saying he was aiming at a seal.\nHe also told police that he stepped on the gun, causing it to fire.\nBut still, after six days of deliberation, the illegal Mexcian immigrant was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges and also found not guilty of assault with a firearm.\nGarcia Zarate was found guilty of illegal firearms possession, which carries a sentence of 16 months to three years.\n* * *\nThe public defender wasted no time in focusing his thoughts on President Trump and his administration…saying Zarate was “extremely relieved” by the outcome and that while Steinle’s death “was a horrible tragedy,” it was used as “political fodder for then candidate Donald Trump’s anti-immigration agenda.”\nAdachi added, “Despite the unfairly politicized atmosphere surrounding this case, jurors focused on the evidence, which was clear and convincing, and rendered a just verdict.”\nIn a response to the verdict, Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a statement saying that despite California’s attempt at a murder conviction, Zarate was able to walk away with only a firearm possession conviction because he was not turned over by San Francisco to ICE.\n“When jurisdictions choose to return criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities, they put the public’s safety at risk,” the statement said.\n“San Francisco’s decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.” Sessions continued, “I urge the leaders of the nation’s communities to reflect on the outcome of this case and consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to cooperate with federal law enforcement officers.”\nSocial media erupted with outrage at the verdict (with very few – if any attempting to defend the verdict)…\nI don't know any American citizen who is a 5x felon and could get away with killing someone with a stolen gun.\n#KateSteinle #KatesLaw #JoseZarate — Ginger

although Hizb ut-Tahrir is banned in many countries, it still has an international presence, and recently held a conference in Chicago.\nNor is the desire to establish a global caliphate limited to Hizb ut-Tahrir alone.\nThe word khalifa means “successor”; the caliph in Sunni Islamic theology is the successor of Muhammad as the military, political, and spiritual leader of the Muslims.\nAs I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS , the great caliphates of history, from the immediate post-Muhammad period of the “Rightly Guided Caliphs” to the Umayyads, Abbasids, and Ottomans, as well as other Islamic states, all waged relentless jihad warfare against non-Muslims, subjugating them under the rule of Islamic law and denying them basic rights.\nThese weren’t the actions of a “tiny minority of extremists,” abhorred by the vast majority of peaceful Muslims for “hijacking” their religion.\nThis was, for fourteen centuries, mainstream, normative Islam, carried forth by the primary authorities in the Islamic world at the time.\nThe History of Jihad shows from the accounts of eyewitnesses and contemporary chroniclers through the ages that in every age and in every place where there were Muslims, some of them believed that they had a responsibility given to them by Allah to wage war against and subjugate unbelievers under the rule of Islamic law.\nAnd so it is today: Said Khecharem has enunciated that responsibility more clearly and directly than most Muslim spokesmen do these days, but he is by no means the only one who believes that it exists.\nWhat is noteworthy also about The History of Jihad is something that it does not contain.\nAs the jihadis move against non-Muslim states without any letup, pause, period of coexistence, period of tolerance, reformation, or reconsideration, there never appears any force of Muslims to oppose them.\nWhile it is undoubtedly true that not all Muslims in any given age have ever waged jihad, there has never been in Islamic history an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad and dedicated to stopping those who were waging it.\nSo it is today.\nIslamic groups in the West issue pro-forma condemnations after every jihad terror attack, but are doing little or nothing to try to prevent the next one.\nThere is still no mosque or Islamic school in the United States that teaches young Muslims why they should reject the understanding of Islam taught by al-Qaeda, ISIS, and other jihad terror groups.\nMeanwhile, Said Khecharem and other Islamic spokesmen openly call for Muslims to engage in jihad conquest.\nWestern authorities should be pondering his words, and their implications, very carefully.\nInstead, if they have taken any notice of him at all, which is unlikely, they have dismissed him as an “extremist.”\nThey have yet to come to grips with the fact that “extremism” is and always has been so distressingly widespread in Muslim communities.\nBut they will.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|253|287\nLoaded_Language|472|485\nFlag-Waving|314|470\nFlag-Waving|573|973\nLoaded_Language|1561|1580\nLoaded_Language|1705|1754\nName_Calling,Labeling|3068|3181\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|4561|4757\nName_Calling,Labeling|5057|5070\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|5073|5222\nName_Calling,Labeling|1616|1648\nLoaded_Language|3156|3165."}
{"prompt":"New Audio From The Night Of The Las Vegas Massacre Reveals That There Was “Another Active Shooter” In The Bar At The Top Of The Mandalay Bay Hotel During The Attack\n\nNewly released audio from the Clark County Fire Department has provided even more proof that there were multiple shooters during The Las Vegas Massacre, further debunking the official narrative of a lone gunman on the 32nd floor and once again calling into question almost every aspect of what actually happened during the worst mass shooting in American history.\nThe audio, released on the SoundCloud account of a local news reporter, is an almost three hour recording of transmissions between dispatch and units on the ground amid the confusion of the mass shooting that at one point details a report that a wife of a firefighter was actually pinned down in the Foundation Room bar on top of the Mandalay Hotel.\nIntellihub’s Shepard Ambellas, who has extensively reported on the entire Vegas cover-up since the beginning, recently found that at around the 1:27:54 mark of the audio file you can clearly hear dispatch describing the situation to first responders who are headed in that direction.\n“We have a firefighter’s wife at this event who is pinned down behind the bar at Mandalay Bay.\nWe are trying to get further on the name,” dispatch frantically notes.\n“Batallion 6, be advised that we are getting reports on Mandalay Bay, at the bar, we currently have, another active shooter up there.”\nAfter being asked to confirm the information, dispatch goes on to make clear that she is specifically speaking about the bar at the top of the hotel rather than anywhere near the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock supposedly operated from.\n“The only information I have is it’s the bar on top of the Mandalay Bay,” dispatch continues before being asked if the shooter was pinned down or “just sheltering right now?”\nInterestingly, the story doesn’t end there, as Ambellas wrote in his piece, author and entrepreneur Grant Cardone was actually holding an investors meeting in the very same bar shortly before the attack took place.\nThe popular social media influencer apparently left the Foundation Room literally seven minutes before authorities claim Paddock opened fire from his 32nd floor room.\nCardone wrote about his experience in a post on Medium in which he claimed that the Mandalay Bay was telling visitors that there was at least one active shooter, “moving” throughout the hotel shooting people.\nIt was reported by the Mandalay there was a shooter moving through the hotel.\nI told Elena and Johnny, “stay close to me, we are not running out, stay calm, there is one person in charge — where I go, you follow, no matter what.” […] About this time, there was starting to be a lot more activity through the casino and now the reports suggested there was active multiple terrorists moving through the hotel shooting guest.\nThen twitter started showing up with feeds suggesting multiple hotels being attacked, bomb threats, and more.\nThis new report documenting yet another instance of a possible second shooter comes on the heels of dozens of similar reports, with the most recent arriving in the form of air traffic control audio that directly stated that there were active shooters on the runway.\n“During the air traffic control recordings, which were released by political strategist and co-founder of “The New Right” Mike Tokes, one of the dispatchers is heard telling an incoming plane that landing might not be a good idea because there were multiple active shooters on the airport property itself,” SHTFplan reported.\n“Shutting down might not be a good idea, there’s active shooters on the runway,” he declared.\n“The 19s are closed, we are in the process of trying to round them up, they are on the airport property.”\nAir traffic control tapes on the night of the Las Vegas shooting: “There’s active shooters on the runway.\nThey’re on the airport property” pic.twitter.com\/HZf3LBeAgk — Mike Tokes (@MikeTokes) October 29, 2017\nSlowly but surely we are beginning to see the truth about the horrific attack come to light despite authorities desperately trying to prevent it from reaching the American people.\nSadly, the picture emerging is one that includes a shocking amount of evidence pointing towards a classic deep state false flag operation.\n>","completion":" Doubt|4007|4185\nFlag-Waving|4107|4185\nDoubt|4187|4324\nLoaded_Language|4285|4324."}
{"prompt":"Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot\n\nLast week Pope Francis announced he was reviving a panel he created to advise the Vatican on how to handle sexual abuse by clergy.\nThe issue has dogged the Roman Catholic Church in recent years, and critics have accused Francis and his two predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, of failing to aggressively weed out and punish predator priests.\nHere’s a look what drove the panel’s creation and what to expect in the future.\nWhat is Pope Francis’ commission on sexual abuse?\nFollowing criticism he was not focusing on halting child abuse within the church, Francis created the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors in March 2014, naming Cardinal Sean O’Malley, the archbishop of Boston, to run it.\nO’Malley was not only a member of the pope’s “G9” group of close advisors; he was also the man who sought to clean up the abuse scandal in Boston after the departure of his predecessor, Cardinal Bernard Law, whose shifting of predator priests to new posts was exposed by the Boston Globe and chronicled in the movie “Spotlight.”\nThe revelations about Law, who died in December, emboldened abuse victims across the country and world, who began speaking up about the priests who had molested them.\nWhen he created the commission, Francis said: “The commission’s specific task is to propose to me the most opportune initiatives for protecting minors and vulnerable adults, in order that we may do everything possible to ensure that crimes such as those which have occurred are no longer repeated in the Church.”\nWhy is it being renewed now?\nAfter the commission’s three-year mandate expired in December, Francis relaunched it on Feb. 17 with some members reappointed and nine new members added, some of whom are victims of abuse, although the Vatican declined to say which, opting to respect their privacy.\nO’Malley returns as chief.\nNew members come from Australia, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, the Netherlands and Tonga, \"reflecting the global reach of the church and the challenge of creating safeguarding structures in diverse cultural context,” the Vatican said.\nWhat did the first commission achieve?\nThe Vatican has said it “worked with almost 200 dioceses and religious communities worldwide to raise awareness and to educate people on the need for safeguarding in our homes, parishes, schools, hospitals, and other institutions.”\nWhat didn’t it do?\nCommission members quickly realized they needed to go beyond raising awareness and deal with the bishops who quietly shift offenders to new dioceses when they are exposed as molesters and rapists.\nEven if church laws already existed to hold bishops accountable for their priests’ behavior, those strictures were not enough, O’Malley said in 2014.\n“There are, theoretically I guess, canons that could apply here, but obviously they have not been sufficient,” he said.\nThe commission was behind Francis’ decision in 2015 to create a new tribunal to judge bishops caught covering up for abusive priests, and to fund it for five years.\nBut amid myriad legal questions over what exact powers the court would have, it never got off the ground.\nIn 2016, Francis officially killed the plan to create it, issuing a document that essentially called on using existing procedures to tackle the problem.\nFrancis was also criticized when Australian Cardinal George Pell, whom he had brought to Rome to clean up Vatican finances, was forced to return to Australia last year to face charges of sexual assault.\nAny other problems?\nCommission members said bishops should call the police when they discovered predator priests, rather than phone the nearest religious retreat to “park” the priest out of harm’s way.\nBut this simple message was hard to get across.\nIt emerged that during a Vatican training course for new bishops in September 2015 a French priest informed bishops they had no obligation to report abuse to the police, forcing the commission to issue a strong statement saying bishops had every obligation to do so.\nDid commission members persevere?\nNot all of them.\nBritish member Peter Saunders, a former victim of priestly abuse, was ousted in 2016.\nHe said the group was a toothless, paper-shuffling exercise.\nIrish member Marie Collins, another victim, resigned in March last year and said Vatican bureaucrats had refused to comply with the commission’s request — approved by the pope — to respond to all letters sent to the Vatican by abuse victims.\nMarie Collins, then a member of the pope's sex abuse commission, in 2015 hands a letter to Cardinal Sean O'Malley detailing the abuse suffered by Juan Carlos Cruz of Chile.\nCatherine Bonnet \/ Associated Press\nWas the pope listening to the commission?\nPossibly not.\nIn 2015, Collins handed O’Malley a letter addressed to the pope from Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean abused as a boy by Chilean prelate Fernando Karadima, who was sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of penance in 2010.\nCruz described how the abuse was witnessed and covered up by Juan Barros, a priest whose appointment as a bishop in 2015 prompted huge protests in Chile.\nThe pope has stuck by Barros, dismissing the protesters as “lefties” and hugging Barros publicly during his visit to Chile last month.\n\"I can't condemn [Barros] because I don't have evidence,\" he said on the plane back to Rome, suggesting he had ignored or never read the letter from Cruz.\nThat was too much for O’Malley, who said Francis had caused \"great pain” to victims.\nIf Francis was not listening to the commission about Barros, whom was he listening to?\nVatican watchers believe the pope was influenced by Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errazuriz, a member of the G9 group who has backed Barros and reportedly helped block moves to make Cruz a member of the abuse commission.\nSo is the pope intransigent on Barros?\nNo.\nSomething changed his mind after his Chilean trip, possibly the scale of the protest against Barros in the country.\nOn Feb. 17, he sent a senior Vatican sex abuse investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to New York to interview Cruz, who now lives in Philadelphia.\n\"For the first time I felt that someone is listening,\" Cruz said after the meeting.\nWhat happens next?\n“This should lead to Barros stepping down,” said Saunders, who is forming his own campaign group with Cruz and others to fight clerical abuse.\nThe new papal commission will meanwhile hold its first meeting in April.\nSupport

{"prompt":"Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack\n\nNewly released footage of the Las Vegas Massacre, captured by a private surveillance camera and recently released by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, has once again ignited the theory that helicopters were used during the horrific attack.\nOver the last month multiple videos have been released that many believe show helicopters either conducting an attack on the Vegas Strip or attempting to stop those that were and now, with this latest evidence release, that possibility seems all the more plausible.\nAs Shepard Ambellas reported for Intellihub, “The [footage] is presumed to have been captured by a nearby business’s southward facing security camera which is located approximately 780 feet due east of the venue where the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival was held on Oct. 1.\nThe tape was given to Fox News by an attorney who represents several shooting victims.”\nAmazingly, the surveillance camera captured what seems to show a “large amount” of wind and debris being kicked up by a nearby helicopter hovering above the attack and or taking part in it.\n“Astonishingly, between the times of 10:13 and 10:16 a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera,” Ambellas continued.\n“By 10:14 much larger crowds of people can be seen streaming through the area to escape the massacre going on,” Carlson reported.\n“You can see a large amount of wind and debris, apparently that is due to a helicopter hovering overhead.”\nThe footage goes how to show two men attempt to help a victim who had apparently been shot, eventually resorting to covering up the body after they realized it was simply too late.\nAmbellas also reported on what his research indicates were documented helicopters in the air at the time.\nA quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m., several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen.\nHowever, the departure of the choppers and the fact that several of them overflew the parking lot does not explain all of the debris being kicked up from by a heavy downdraft, prop wash, possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer.\nIn fact, the downdraft appears to be constant from 10:13-10:16 p.m. and not intermittent as if several choppers had just passed overhead.\nAs I have reported in the past, multiple other videos taken on the night of the attack also seem to point to helicopters being used throughout the city.\n“Footage has emerged that may show muzzle flashes coming from the helicopter in what looks to be evidence that a team was firing into the crowd from the air on that fateful night,” read a report in The Daily Sheeple.\n“Despite claims by some that these are “strobes” it remains unlikely that this is the case, especially when you consider other footage of the helicopter taken on the night as well as research by a group of investigators who believe the first attack on October 1st was carried out from the air.”\nIt is also important to keep in mind that there is footage of a still unidentified team loading up gear in a helicopter near the scene of the attack.\n“In what can only be described as a “WTF video” the following footage seems to literally show a team of unknown soldiers gearing up next to a helicopter near the Route 91 concert.”\nAdditionally, Carlson also noted during the initial broadcast of the private surveillance footage that the owner of the camera was never approached by the FBI, who have so far never seen the footage, much less investigated it.\nWhile we may never know what actually happened during the Las Vegas Massacre, the fact remains that the official story has been proven, time and time again, to be absolutely false and in fact nothing more than a pathetic attempt at a cover-up.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|3353|3363\nDoubt|3802|3966\nDoubt|992|1001\nDoubt|2911|2939\nDoubt|3724|3747\nLoaded_Language|3934|3952."}
{"prompt":"Muslim Crime Stopper Sofian Zakkout's New Crush: Anti-Semite Pastor Steve Anderson\n\nFor nearly two millennia, Jews have suffered persecution after persecution at the hands of those who used religion as a vehicle for hate and even mass murder.\nRecently, a video clip of anti-Semitic pastor Steve Anderson – making the claim that Jews have experienced such abuse because they have somehow been cursed – wound up on the personal Facebook page of South Florida Muslim leader Sofian Zakkout.\nAccording to Zakkout, who sits on the boards of two anti-crime groups, Anderson’s declaration “makes a lot of sense.” With statements like this from Zakkout and worse, why would groups committed to fighting crime continue to compromise themselves and sabotage their mission by affiliating with him?\nSofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA), a prominent Islamic organization headquartered in North Miami Beach, Florida.\nOn January 25th, Zakkout posted onto his personal Facebook page a video clip of a speech made by Steve Anderson, the pastor of the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona.\nAnderson is notorious for calling for the killing of gays to end AIDS.\nIn the clip, Anderson states the following: “And the Jews were scattered into all nations for literally 2000 years, right?\nFor 1800 sum odd years.\nAnd by the way, everywhere they were scattered, they were persecuted, hated, treated badly.\nWhy?\n‘Cause God’s blessing them?\nNo.\n‘Cause they’re under the curse of God for having rejected the Lord Jesus Christ.”\nBlaming Jews for the extreme torment they endured for so long, which includes a Nazi Holocaust that took the lives of six million innocent Jews and so many others, is incredibly offensive.\nIndeed, statements and beliefs such as Anderson’s have provoked hatred and persecution of Jews.\nTowards the end of the clip, which is less than four minutes in length, Anderson throws the anti-Semitism in people’s faces.\nHe zealously states, while drawing laughter from his small audience, “You say, ‘Why are you preaching against the Jews?’ Well, don’t come back next Wednesday night.\nBecause, next Wednesday night, God’s wrath is on the Jews even more!”\nAbout the clip, on Facebook, Zakkout wrote above it, “Makes a lot of sense!” Of course, this is coming from someone [Zakkout] who regularly refers to Jews as “monkeys and pigs,” and in February 2016, circulated on social media a report claiming that “the Holocaust was faked.” The report calls the Holocaust “the biggest lie ever foisted upon humanity” and was produced by a media outlet which describes Hitler as “the greatest leader in modern Western history.”\nBoth Anderson and Zakkout have been denounced by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for their propagation of anti-Semitism.\nIn July 2010, the ADL condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring an anti-Jewish video produced by former KKK leader and white supremacist David Duke on the AMANA website.\nThe ADL described the video as “venomous.” In October 2015, Zakkout praised Duke, as “David Duke, a man to believe in!”\nBesides posting videos from Steve Anderson and David Duke on his Facebook page, Zakkout also, in July 2017, posted a four minute clip from a speech made by Nation of Islam (NOI) leader Louis Farrakhan.\nDuring the clip, Farrakhan repeatedly labels the Jewish people “Satan.” He states, “Really, they’re not Jews.\nNo, that’s Satan.\nYou should learn to call them by their real name, ‘Satan.’ You’re coming face to face with Satan, the Arch Deceiver, the enemy of God, and the enemy of the righteous.”\nZakkout is also an ardent supporter of the terrorist organization Hamas, if not a member himself.\nIn July 2014, he organized a pro-Hamas rally held outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Miami.\nRally goers repeatedly shouted, “We are Hamas” and “Let’s go Hamas.” After the rally, Zakkout wrote the following in Arabic, above photos from the event: “Thank God, every day we conquer the American Jews like our conquests over the Jews of Israel!” He signed it “Br.\nSofian Zakkout.” The next month, Zakkout declared in Arabic, \"Hamas is in my heart and on my head.\"\nAll of the above testifies to hatred and intolerance, but it is even more disturbing given the fact that Zakkout sits on the boards of two anti-crime organizations: Crime Stoppers of Miami-Dade County and Citizens’ Crime Watch of Miami-Dade County.\nServing alongside Zakkout on these boards are local politicians and law enforcement officials.\nOne would think that they would find Zakkout’s actions and bigotry unacceptable, as well, yet Zakkout continues to serve unchallenged.\nIf the board members of Crime Stoppers and Citizens’ Crime Watch do not wish to be associated with anti-Semitism or white supremacism or Hamas or Holocaust denial or Steve Anderson or David Duke or Louis Farrakhan, then they must cut ties with Sofian Zakkout.\nThe time is long overdue that these groups maintain their credibility and remain true to their stated missions of protecting and safeguarding the American public.\nSofian Zakkout’s bigoted and radical agenda is antithetical to this and is a documented threat to national security.\nHis presence on the boards of both organizations constitutes an obscene travesty.\nOnce and for all, these groups need to divorce themselves from Zakkout and repudiate what he stands for.\nBeila Rabinowitz, Director of Militant Islam Monitor, contributed to this report.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case\n\nWASHINGTON — Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo expressed confidence Wednesday that the Saudi government could be trusted to investigate the disappearance and suspected murder of a U.S.-based Saudi journalist in a Saudi diplomatic facility in Turkey — despite the likelihood that senior Saudi officials were involved.\nSpeaking in Ankara, Turkey, Pompeo offered that support hours after President Donald Trump had mounted an even stronger defense for the Saudi rulers, saying, “Here we go again with you’re guilty until proven innocent.”\nTogether they appeared to signal a shift in White House strategy — earlier this week Trump had warned Saudi rulers could face “severe punishment” — and suggested the administration has decided to help its most important ally in the Arab world defuse an international crisis over the fate of Jamal Khashoggi.\nThe dissident journalist, who lived in Virginia, vanished Oct. 2 after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.\nNeither Trump nor his top diplomat offered any new facts or insights in the case.\nBut unless authorities recover his body or other conclusive evidence of his death, the mystery may remain unsolved.\nPompeo wrapped up two days of emergency talks in the region — first with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, and then with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara — and headed back to Washington on Wednesday.\nTurkish officials have described — but have not released — what they say are audio and video recordings that show the 60-year-old contributor to the Washington Post opinion pages was interrogated, tortured and killed by Saudi intelligence officers inside the consulate.\nTurkish officials say Khashoggi’s body was cut up with a bone saw, then taken out of the building.\nTurkish crime scene investigators and forensic specialists were allowed to search for evidence in the Saudi consulate and a nearby residence on Tuesday.\nErdogan later complained that the interior walls had been repainted in recent days.\nOn his flight from Riyadh to Ankara, Pompeo reiterated his confidence that the Saudi government would conduct a “thorough, complete, and transparent investigation,” adding that they will “show the entire world” the results.\nHe said Saudi leaders made a commitment “to hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that, whether they are a senior officer or official.” He said they made “no exceptions,” including presumably members of the royal family.\nAsked if the Saudis had informed him whether Khashoggi was alive or dead, Pompeo said, “I don’t want to talk about any of the facts.\nThey didn’t want to either, in that they want to have the opportunity to complete this investigation in a thorough way.”\nAsked if he believed the Saudi rulers’ repeated denial of complicity, Pompeo said he was reserving judgment.\n“I think that’s — I think that’s — I think that’s a reasonable thing to do, to give them that opportunity,” Pompeo said, “(and then) we’ll all get to evaluate the work that they do.”\nPompeo refused to discuss possible consequences for those found responsible for Khashoggi’s disappearance, reiterating at least three times the “importance of the investigation.”\nLater Wednesday, Pompeo said during a refueling stopover in Brussels that Erdogan had informed him the Saudis were cooperating with the Turkish investigation “after a couple of delays.”\nTurkish officials “seemed pretty confident the Saudis will permit them to do things they need to do to complete” the investigation, Pompeo told reporters traveling with him.\nIn a sign that the administration is looking to help Saudi Arabia get out of its dilemma, Pompeo urged Americans to be mindful of the extensive energy, economic and security ties between Riyadh and Washington, including efforts against what he called the world’s largest supporter of terrorism, Iran.\n“The Saudis have been great partners in working alongside us on these issues,” Pompeo said.\n“We need to make sure we are mindful of that as we approach decisions” on whether to impose sanctions or take other punitive steps against Riyadh, as many in Congress and elsewhere have urged.\nCritics questioned whether the Saudi rulers, who preside over an authoritarian regime that allows little opposition, can be relied on to conduct a credible probe into Khashoggi’s fate — especially without decisive pressure from their close ally, the Trump administration.\nSaudi leaders for two weeks denied knowing anything about the Khashoggi case.\nOn Monday, they began floating a scenario — initially adopted by Trump — that blamed the murder inside the consulate on “rogue killers,” and then suggested the writer was accidentally killed during an interrogation that went awry.\nAnalysts familiar with the desert kingdom said it was likely Saudi leaders were hoping the scandal would blow over and that they could wait it out.\n“We received commitments that they would complete this (investigation), and I am counting on them to do that,” Pompeo said.\n“They gave me their word.”\n— Tracy Wilkinson\nLos Angeles Times\n———\n©2018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by

{"prompt":"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: \"Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium\" (Now what?)\n\nGiven that Pope Francis has, since that interview took place, attempted to make the Argentine bishops’ interpretation of AL 'magisterial'--an interpretation that allows public adulterers to receive Holy Communion--Cardinal Burke’s reply to my question on January 9th of this year would seem to take on new relevancy.\nIn my interview of Raymond Cardinal Burke less than one year ago, I asked His Eminence to clarify what, exactly, is the level of authoritative weight of Pope Francis’s post-synodal exhortation, Amoris Laetitia.\nNow, Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, president of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, made it very clear to the Catholic News Service on December 5 what the Pope is up to: “The fact that the pope requested that his letter and the interpretations of the Buenos Aires bishops be published in the AAS means that His Holiness has given these documents a particular qualification that elevates them to the level of being official teachings of the church.\nWhile the content of the pope’s letter itself does not contain teachings on faith and morals, it does point toward the interpretations of the Argentine bishops and confirms them as authentically reflecting his own mind.\nThus together the two documents became the Holy Father’s authentic magisterium for the whole church.”\nWhat Cardinal Burke rightly describes as lacking in any magisterial weight whatsoever—and, in fact, in dire need of clarification and correction— has by papal fiat been declared magisterial, and thus binding on us all.\nFrancis made it clear that the Argentine bishops’ interpretation of AL allowing public adulterers to receive Holy Communion “explains precisely the meaning of Chapter VIII of ‘Amoris Laetitia.’ There are no other interpretations.”\nI would imagine this outrageous overreach of papal authority on the Pope's part would make it ominously clear to Cardinal Burke that the time has come to issue his public correction of Pope Francis's erroneous teaching.\nThe moment, it would seem, has come.\nCardinal Burke, please and in God's Holy Name, we beg you to act now -- before Pope Francis succeeds in tearing the Church in half completely.\nWe fear that your silence now, in the face of this latest papal travesty, may suggest consent to the claim that Amoris Laetitia is magisterial, and thus prove more damaging than if you had never raised your voice at all.\nWe thank God for the courage you've shown in defending His Church thus far, and we pray he will continue to bless and protect you as you do what must now be done.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|1438|1483\nAppeal_to_Authority|1616|1846\nLoaded_Language|1868|1907\nLoaded_Language|1941|1956\nLoaded_Language|2293|2319\nLoaded_Language|2134|2245."}
{"prompt":"Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections\n\n(Fixes dateline)\n* PM Orban faces elections on April 8, leads all polls\n* Migration has been Orban's defining theme since 2015\n* Says will counter globalism alongside U.S., UK, Israel\nBy Marton Dunai\nBUDAPEST, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Hungarian leader Viktor Orban called on Sunday for a global alliance against migration as his right-wing populist Fidesz party began campaigning for an April 8 election in which it is expected to win a third consecutive landslide victory.\nPopular at home but increasingly at odds politically and economically with mainstream European Union peers, Orban has thrived on external controversy, including repeated clashes with Brussels and lately the United Nations.\nThose conflicts, mostly centred on migration since people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa flooded into Europe in 2015, have intensified as the elections approach and Orban poses as a saviour of Europe's Christian nations.\n\"Christianity is Europe's last hope,\" Orban told an audience of party faithful at the foot of the Royal Castle in Budapest.\nWith mass immigration, especially from Africa, \"our worst nightmares can come true.\nThe West falls as it fails to see Europe being overrun.\"\nOrban is widely credited for reversing an economic slump in Hungary and controlling its public finances, culminating in a return to investment-grade for its debt, which was cut to 'junk' during the 2008 global economic crisis.\nTo achieve that and hold onto power the prime minister, 54, has used methods that critics have called authoritarian, and picked fights with EU partners, especially in the West.\nEastern leaders, most notably in Poland, have followed his lead.\nBut migration dominates his agenda now.\nOrban said on Sunday that Europe faces a critical fissure between nation states of the East and the West, which he called an \"immigrant zone, a mixed population world that heads in a direction different from ours\".\nAs the West wants eastern Europe to follow its lead, an increasingly vicious struggle was likely, he said, alluding to a plan to redraw the European alliance advocated by the leaders of France and Germany.\n\"Absurd as it may sound the danger we face comes from the West, from politicians in Brussels, Berlin and Paris,\" Orban said to loud applause.\n\"Of course we will fight, and use ever stronger legal tools.\nThe first is our 'Stop Soros' law.\"\nOrban has for years targeted Hungarian-born U.S. financier George Soros, whose philanthropy aims to bolster liberal and open-border values -- anathema to Orban, an advocate of a loose group of strong nation states that reject multiculturalism.\nThe Hungarian leader has advocated \"ethnic homogeneity\" and compared Soros, a Jew, to a puppet master unleashing immigration onto Europe to undermine its cultural and economic integrity.\nA defining moment of his premiership came in 2015, as the migrant crisis peaked: he built a double razor wire fence that became the symbol of anti-migrant sentiment in Europe.\nOrban also said the Hungarian opposition had failed to heed the call of history when it opposed his toughness on migrants.\nVoters have responded favourably and Orban is a clear leader of all polls.\nPOWERFUL ALLIES\nOrban has conflated the issue of immigration with the image of Soros, 87, whose name was used in a tough anti-migrant bill sent to Parliament on Wednesday.\nSoros, for his part, compared Orban unfavourably to both the Nazis and the Communists, saying his rule evoked dark tones from the 1930's -- when Hungary was allied with Nazi Germany -- and was more oppressive than Cold War Soviet occupation.\nOrban has tightened the screws on non-government organisations, particularly ones funded by Soros, and attempted to close a prominent Soros-founded university.\nAttributing to Soros a recent United Nations plan on creating a global blueprint to handle the migration crisis, Orban said he anticipated that powerful allies would help him prevent the U.N. from greasing the wheels of migration.\n\"Soros has antagonised not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too,\" he said.\n\"Everywhere he wants to get migration accepted.\nIt won't work.\nWe are not alone and we will fight together ... and we will succeed.\"\nIn Europe, he cited as allies Hungary's fellow Visegrad countries Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland, whose ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party is also often at loggerheads with the EU.\nHe said a victory for Silvio Berlusconi's party in Italy's March 4 election would strengthen the nationalist fold.\n\"We don't think the fight is hopeless, on the contrary, we are winning,\" Orban said.\n\"The V4 is firm, Croatia has come around, Austria has turned in the patriotic direction, and in Bavaria the CSU has created a resistance.\"\n(Reporting by Marton Dunai;

{"prompt":"Apparently, They Think We are Fools\n\nAs Pope Francis continues his five-year-long tirade against the imaginary Catholic Pharisees who defend the Church’s teaching on the indissolubility of marriage and the integrally related Eucharistic discipline—he is still at it as of yesterday (January 9)—he and his collaborators are busily engineering neo-Pharisaical escape hatches from the negative precepts of the divine and natural law emanating from the Sixth Commandment.\nDetermined to quell any Catholic opposition to his moral subversion, Francis has slapped the label Authentic Magisterium® on his outrageous opinion that in “complex circumstances” wherein it is not “feasible” to live as brother and sister, two people who are not married can be admitted to Holy Communion without ceasing extra-marital sexual relations so long as they engage in an ill-defined “process of discernment.” As Father Brian Harrison has so trenchantly observed, this means that people embroiled in adultery can receive Holy Communion while they “discern” that they should not be receiving Holy Communion because they are embroiled in adultery.\nDo they think we are fools?\nThen there is the endlessly double-talking Cardinal Müller.\nIn a recent interview concerning Rocco Buttiglione’s verbal contortions aimed at demonstrating that the administration of Holy Communion to public adulterers is consistent with the Church’s bimillenial prohibition of precisely that, Müller proposed this preposterous “solution” to a “problem” that does not exist:\nIt is possible that the penitent may be convinced in conscience, and with good reasons, of the invalidity of the first marriage even though they cannot offer canonical proof.\nIn this case the marriage valid before God would be the second one and the pastor could grant the sacrament, certainly with the appropriate precautions as not to scandalize the community of the faithful and not to weaken the conviction of marriage indissolubility.\nThe Cardinal knows this is moral and canonical nonsense.\nNo Catholic, whether or not he consults a priest, can declare for himself that his marriage in the Church was invalid, especially when—indeed because—he lacks canonical proof of invalidity.\nMoreover, absent an annulment granted by the competent Church tribunal, a purported “second marriage” can only be an invalid civil ceremony and thus a thinly disguised form of continuous public adultery.\nCardinal Burke, whom Francis sacked as head of the Church’s highest tribunal because he was a major impediment to the conspiracy culminating in Amoris Laetitia (AL), has observed the obvious in this regard:\nSuch cases do not exist.\nNo priest has the authority to declare a marriage null in the internal forum.\nMarriage is a public state in the Church, and the judgment regarding an accusation of nullity of marriage must be made in accord with the long practice of the Church.\nIf a college of judges in a matrimonial tribunal is not able to arrive at moral certitude regarding the nullity of a marriage after a careful and thorough examination of the petition of nullity, how can an individual priest be capable of making such a judgment having to do with the eternal salvation of the soul in question?\nThe only case in which a priest could admit a person living in an irregular matrimonial union to receive the Sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist is the case of a couple who agree to live “as brother and sister”, that is to respect the marriage to which they are bound by not living in a marital way with another person.\nEven then, the priest would have to insist that the couple living in continence receive the Sacraments in a place in which they are not well known, lest other faithful be led to believe that persons living in an irregular matrimonial union may receive the Sacraments.\nDoes Cardinal Müller think we are fools?\nSome of us apparently are, or at least are willing to serve as knowing dupes by defending neo-Pharisaical sophistry that would produce “a discipline alien to the entire Tradition of the Catholic and Apostolic faith.”\nApparently, they think they can fool us in the next phase of the program of moral subversion that this incredible Pope seriously expects us to believe is an imperative of “mercy”: the justification of contraception in “complex cases” to which “discernment” must be applied.\nConsider the recent declaration by one of Francis’s new appointments to the Pontifical Academy for Life, whose entire membership he sacked and whose constitution he ordered rewritten to neutralize it.\nIn a lecture at the Gregorian, one Father Maurizio Chiodi, a “moral theologian” of the post-Vatican II variety, proposed that “an artificial method for the regulation of births could be recognized as anact of responsibilitythat is carried out, not in order to radically reject the gift of a child, but because in those situationsresponsibility calls the couple and the family to other forms of welcome and hospitality.”\nThat is, Francis’s man at the reconstituted Pontifical Academy declares openly that there is a duty to contracept!\nChiodi’s sole “authority” for this lie from the pit of hell is nothing more than Chapter 8 of AL, the only document of its kind in the entire history of the Church.\nAL will doubtless be providing cover for a whole new line of Authentic Magisterium® products, all of which will be utter fakes, including some form of “pastoral integration” of homosexual unions.\nEvidently, they do think we are fools or willing to play the fool in exchange for the benefits of respectable conformity in the midst of an unparalleled debacle for the Church.\n(Consider the example of Catholic Answers, which “defends the Faith” while refusing to recognize that it is under ferocious attack from the very vertices of the Church.\nSilence at best is the price it must pay for remaining in good standing with the pro-homosexual bishop Francis has installed in San Diego.)\nBut we are not fools.\nAnd God will not be mocked.\nFrancis and all his designs will ultimately come to nothing.\nMeanwhile, ours is but to keep the Faith and protest before God and man the blows now raining down against the Church, even when they come from a wayward Roman Pontiff at her summit.\nIndeed, especially then.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Et Tu, Benedict?\n(Some Final Thoughts on Joseph Ratzinger)\n\nRecently an editor of a “conservative” Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, five years on.\nI declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies.\nIt’s been five years, and I’ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a “courageous” act it was to give up the pontificate.\nThe consequences of that act have been so outlandish – even for people who are mostly OK with Francis – that very few people are still willing to make polite noises about it.\nEditor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr.\nDario Vigano, prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, the former pope reportedly offers an impassioned defense of Pope Francis against the claim that he lacks theological and philosophical formation.\nIn no uncertain terms, this letter, bearing Benedict's signature, affirms that “there is an internal continuity between the two pontificates.” Whether Benedict actually wrote this letter or not, it gives rise to a number of grave questions that need to be answered rather urgently before history closes the book on this commedia diabolica.\nOur thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below.\nMJM\nIn fact, five years after the resignation of Pope Benedict the Catholic faithful mostly want to know why; why would a pope – a man with decades of up-close-and-personal experience of the “filth” in the Curia and throughout the church – suddenly just decide to quit?\nWhy would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed?\nAt the time and since then, particularly in light of what has been happening, it seems one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole bizarre situation that the reasons offered have been so trivial, so inappropriately, so disproportionately petty.\nThese absurd responses to serious questions of grave import have raised the inescapable suspicion that Benedict simply did not take the papacy as seriously as the rest of us did.\nWe cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before.\nCould we have been wrong about him?\nAnd if so, could we have been this wrong?\nFor reasons, all we heard at the time was, essentially, “I’m tired.” There was some implication that he didn’t feel up to international travel anymore, so couldn’t make it to World Youth Day and similar events.\nThe trivialising of the resignation seemed to go hand in hand with the modern concept of the pope-as-pop-star, something we had thought Benedict was too serious a man, too serious a Catholic, to believe himself.\nOf all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously.\nAnd since then, as all the poisons that had been lurking for fifty years in the NewChurch mud are busily hatching out, many Catholics want to know why we hear nothing from him?\nThis man whom we had believed a “champion of orthodoxy,” whom we thought we knew.\nError, even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor, who has, literally, turned the Vatican into a den of thieves, and we hear nothing but the occasional, carefully worded statement on how fine everything is.\nHow content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life.\nAfter three years of systematic dismantling of everything he had attempted to do in his pontificate, we got this from an apparently utterly insouciant Ratzinger, addressed to Francis: “Your goodness is my home and the place where I feel safe.” Everyone who had ever read anything he had written were amazed he was capable of producing such maudlin drivel, but the video doesn’t lie:\nSo strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind.\nBut this is not what we see.\nThere he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud.\n“Perhaps it was written for him.” Well, why repeat it then?\nWhy, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda?\nIf it is a deception, why participate in it?\nIn fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they “miss” him have failed to respect him in one way; they won’t take him at his word.\nSome insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn’t valid.\nBut we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely.\nAnd indeed, far from being an isolated “prisoner of the Vatican,” Benedict has received many guests all of whom report that, though frail, he appears content and never utters a word of criticism.\nWe have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat.\nThere’s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn’t add up, it’s true.\nAll the questions have gone ignored, or have received frivolous, jokey responses:\nWhy did you resign?\nRatzinger: “I was a bit tired and didn’t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.”\nIf you’re not pope, why do you still wear the white?\nRatzinger: “Oh, there wasn’t a black cassock that fit me.”\nWhy do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope?\nRatzinger: “Well, I’m an ‘emeritus,’ you see…”\nAnd where did this “emeritus” business come from?\nDoes it have any precedent in Catholic history?\nWhat does it mean canonically and doctrinally?\nRatzinger: “…”\nWhat was all that rubbish from Ganswein about there being a divided “munus” – with an active member and a “contemplative member”?\nDoesn’t that just mean there are two popes now?\nRatzinger: “…”\nAnd perhaps most agonising of all: “How can you just sit there smiling, issuing bland platitudinous nonsense, while this lunatic drives the sheep off a cliff?”\nA few days ago, my friend Steve Skojec, of the traditionalist\/restorationist website One Peter Five, summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for (the man we used to call) Pope Benedict.\nSteve summons up in this brief post all the anger and all the crushing disappointment most of us probably still feel reluctant to express out loud:\nFive years ago today, Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy.\nAnd through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time – one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word, deed, or even the subtlest gesture.\nYou may love him for various reasons, you may miss him by contrast, but you may not excuse the responsibility he has.\nHe walked away from his family, leaving the door open to an abusive stepfather, and he watches his children beaten and led astray not just in silence, but in apparent contentment.\nAnd still, he was the best of the post-conciliar popes, which is why he’s the only one who won’t be canonized.\nWho is the real Joseph Ratzinger?\nI have had long-time Vatican watchers say to me, more than once, “Maybe it’s really just that he wasn’t who we thought he was.” I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine.\nI think we made the mistake of believing the press.\nWe were delighted that the bitterly anti-Catholic media hated and feared him.\nWe failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism.\nWhat the papers never told us was that as a young priest and theologian Joseph Ratzinger was known as a “progressive,” as the term was understood in 1962.\nThis reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus, the theological advisor, of one of the Council’s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne.\nFrings’ claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF – and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani – for the “conservatism” in the “schema,” the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops’ discussions.\nAfter this speech, there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema – that had taken years to develop – be abandoned.\nThis was done, over Ottaviani’s futile objections, and new documents were rapidly cobbled together by a coalition of German and French “progressives” who rejoiced that they had, in effect, seized control of the Council from that moment, before it had even started.\nIt has since been revealed that it was Joseph Ratzinger – the maverick “progressive” academic theologian Frings had brought to Rome as his secretary – who wrote that speech.\nCardinal Henri de Lubac, writing in 1985, recalling that drama, said:\n“Joseph Ratzinger, an expert at the Council, was also the private secretary of Card.\nFrings, Archbishop of Cologne.\nBlind, the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions.\nNow then, one of these interventions became memorable: it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office.\nDespite a reply by Card.\nOttaviani, Frings sustained his critique.\n\n“It is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office, as it presented itself then, was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop.\n\n“Card.\nSeper, a man full of goodness, intiated the renovation.\nRatzinger, who did not change, continues it.”\nRatzinger’s reputation as a “progressive” is not based on one incident, nor was it restricted to his early work.\nIt went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF, that he had written in 1982, a call for the Church “never to return” to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX.\nIn his book Principles of Catholic Theology, Ratzinger proposed the question, “Should the Council be revoked?” and in response recommended the “razing of the bastions” of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world:\nThe duty is, therefore, not to suppress the Council, but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then.\n\nThis implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus, which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism, but which cannot be the last word.\nNeither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [relations with] the modern world for the Christian.\nHence, the 'razing of the bastions' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty.\nIt was necessary for her [the Church] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith, the power of the word that is her unique, true, and permanent strength.\nBut to raze the bastions cannot signify that she no longer has anything to protect, or that she can live owing to different forces than those that engendered her: the water and the blood that poured from the open side of her crucified Lord.\nHis was the thesis – a mainstay of “conservative” ideology – that the “real” Council, if only implemented properly, would be the salvation of the Church and the world, a theme he never left.\nHow ironic it must have seemed to those who remembered this history that Ratzinger would himself be given the office he had “destroyed” and would gain the media-generated reputation as an “arch-conservative”.\nAnd it starts to suggest an answer, or at least a line of inquiry, about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure.\nWith the “arch-conservative” “Rottweiler” Ratzinger in CDF, why do we have the situation we have today?\nWhat did he do to stop the explosion of neo-modernism – that burned like an unchecked wildfire throughout the Catholic world through the reign of John Paul II?\nWhat did “silencing” by Ratzinger’s CDF do to stop Hans Kung becoming a celebrity “priest-theologian,” courted by the media for his loathing of Catholicism?\nKung, who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy?\nCan we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree?\nPrecious few.\nBut we can certainly think of many, many who spent their lives and vocations blatantly denying and undermining the Catholic Faith – academic theologians, religious, priests, bishops and cardinals around the world – with never a peep of protest from Rome.\nMoreover, the scandalous pack of frauds we currently have in the episcopate is entirely the product of the “arch-conservative” John Paul II and the “Rottweiler” Benedict XVI pontificates.\nWhy did we think that Ratzinger, in this crucial role of CDF prefect, was a bulwark of orthodoxy?\nIs it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison, to make an objective judgement?\nThe “progressive” destroyer of Ottaviani inheriting his office and the epithet “arch-conservative”…\nIndeed, Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions.\nHe was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological “left” after the 1960s while he stayed in place.\nPerhaps now, as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces, we can finally accept his word on this.\nPerhaps the world of Catholic academic theology had become so corrupted that a man called “progressive” in 1963, but whose ideas remained the same, would look like a “champion of traditional Catholic orthodoxy” by 2005.\nIs this why he resigned?\nIs it simply that his conception of the Church, of the papacy, was never what Catholics believed about it?\nPerhaps a hint at the answer comes from La Stampa in 2015 which published some of the memoirs of Silvano Fausti, SJ, who had been confessor and spiritual guide of Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the godfather of the “liberal” European Catholic Church, and alleged leader of the “Sankt Gallen Mafia” that Cardinal Danneels admitted conspired for years against Pope Benedict.\nFausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops’ palace of Milan in June 2012.\nMartini, Fausti said, urged Benedict to resign the papacy.\nApparently at the time of his election in 2005, Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia.\nBy 2012, this had proved impossible.\nWhy would Benedict take advice from a man like Martini – the “godfather” of the “liberal wing” of European Catholicism?\nI think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger.\nThey were esteemed academic colleagues.\nThey were brothers of the episcopate.\nThey were members of the club.\nAny appearance of ideological division between them was, in essence, a product of the media narrative.\nWhy wouldn’t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal?\nWhy is Walter Kasper a cardinal?\nOne of the most prominent of those puzzle pieces is the apparent inability of these “conservative” prelates, to detect, let alone effectively oppose, these brazen enemies of the Faith within the episcopate and College of Cardinals.\nIt beggars belief of ordinary people that, after so many years of hearing and reading them, Ratzinger would remain on such friendly terms with men like Walter Kasper and Carlo Maria Martini, the alleged brains of the Sankt Gallen Mafia.\nWhen, at his very first Angelus address in 2013, Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper, quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope.\nJorge Bergoglio might have been unknown to the larger Catholic world, but Walter Kasper was a celebrity heretic, the media-savvy frontman for the “ultra-liberal” “wing” of the post-Vatican II Church.\nIn an article on the cardinal’s life’s work, Thomas Jansen, the editor-in-chief of Katholisch.de, recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict.\nThe monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper’s work as Bergoglio’s.\nThis is a man who has, for 40 years, never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome.\nJansen points out that Kasper had already tried to bring out the same proposal for Communion for divorced and remarried in 1993, together with Karl Lehmann, another “Sankt Gallen” member.\nThis was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF.\nBut that raises the next question; if Ratzinger knew so well what kind of creature Kasper was, why wasn’t the next step to pitch him out of the episcopate on his ear?\nWhy was he not – at the very least – given the same “silencing” treatment as Kung?\nKasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic.\nBut it’s a simple truth: he’s a heretic.\nEveryone knows he’s a heretic because we have heard him trumpeting in his blatant heresies from every rooftop he could find for decades.\nAfter openly working against the Faith, instead of being demoted, silenced, laicised and\/or excommunicated, John Paul II made him a cardinal.\nRemember that his scheme to Amoris-Latitia-ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger’s CDF in 1993.\nBut he was not demoted, reprimanded or corrected in any way.\nNor was he removed from places of influence.\nFar from it.\nIn 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.\nIn 1999, he made another step up, being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the “ecumenical” office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign.\nIn 2001, he was made a Cardinal-deacon with the awesome responsibility of voting in a Conclave.\nThen Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal.\nAnd, as if to add a finishing touch to the poisoned cake that is Ratzinger’s involvement in the creation of the New Catholic Paradigm, Benedict is now being said to have deliberately timed his resignation in order to allow his old academic colleague to participate in the 2013 Conclave.\nAs Jansen pointed out, and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five,\nCardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave, because he had just turned 80 years of age.\nBut since the date of the death (or abdication, as it was the case in 2013) of the pope is decisive, he was still able to attend and vote in that election.\n(As some observers noted, it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time.)\nExcuse me Maike, but I don’t think this is a parenthetical issue.\nIs it any wonder that so many Catholics have become disaffected?\nCardinal Ratzinger, Pope “Emeritus” Benedict – whatever you want to call yourself – I have one question that I would really like you to answer: Why is this man still a cardinal?\nWhy is he still a bishop?\nWhy is he still allowed to call himself a “Catholic theologian”?\nWhy did you, apparently deliberately, ensure that he was able to enter the Conclave to decide who your successor was going to be?\nDoesn’t anyone else want to know this?\nDon’t we all want to know why Hans Kung is still a priest?\nWhy was Cardinal Mahony allowed to retire in good standing?\nWhy a man like Weakland, the active homosexual who paid off his ex-lover, was not excommunicated?\nWhat are the names we all remember, just off the top of our heads?\nMy own bishop in Victoria, the occultist Remi de Roo, Seattle’s Raymond Hunthausen, Miami’s Favalora, Rochester’s Matthew Clark, Derek Worlock of Liverpool… I sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over.\nFor fifty years Catholics have wanted to know why nothing was ever done, as these wolves in the episcopate were allowed, year after year to continue attacking the Church.\nWhy have we so often seen these men – compromised intellectually and morally – elevated to superior rank, despite the incredible brazenness of their hatred of the Catholic Faith?\nThe end of “Big Umbrella Catholicism”\nThe New York Times’ Ross Douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions.\nMaike Hickson quotes him, writing of this bizarre situation – in which each, of the so-called “Sankt Gallen Mafia” prelates, including Kasper, who openly campaigned for the effective abolition of Catholic moral teaching: “It was characteristic of the church’s effective truce [between conservatives and progressivists] that John Paul II himself had given most of them their red hats, elevating them despite their disagreement with his restorationist approach.”\nWhen journalists talk about Catholicism, they often speak of a man like Kasper being – as his Wikipedia page puts it – “one of the main figures of the liberal wing of the Catholic Church.” And this is supposed to make some kind of sense to Catholics, we’re supposed to accept it as the reality of our times.\nThere’s a “liberal wing” and a “conservative wing” and they’re both Catholic.\nSteve Skojec told me that our willingness to go along with the whole “emeritus pope” charade was an error: “I think the problem is that we all went along with their game of make believe, and we shouldn’t have.” In fact, I am starting to think that the willingness of most Catholics to go along with the entire charade of post-conciliar Catholicism has been a grave error.\nBy playing along, by pretending that we could be “conservative Catholics” in this New Paradigm that also includes “liberal Catholics” we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history.\nBecause of this schizophrenic mindset of the Church’s leadership since 1965, we have all come to accept the underlying premise; that the Church is a “big umbrella” with plenty of room for people of all personal opinions, that such issues as liturgy are matters of personal “taste” …that two opposed things can both be Catholic truth.\nThis schizophrenia is the model under which “conservatives” have operated all this time, and by which they have judged a man like Joseph Ratzinger to be a “conservative champion of orthodoxy.” And what has this achieved?\nIt created cover for the men of Kasper’s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of Peter five years ago.\nAnd just like that, the jargon of “tolerance” and the “big umbrella” is over and the purge of faithful, believing Catholic religious, seminarians, priests, and academics has begun.\nAs it had to.\nThey, at least, do not harbour this insane contradiction, and understand – and frequently say out loud – that the New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same.\nAnd their New Church is the only one left.\nFor five decades we played the Anglican game; as long as we don’t talk about it, there isn’t a problem.\nOttaviani’s Holy Office and schema were the last gasp of the old Church – and as de Lubac said above, it was killed by Joseph Ratzinger.\nWe had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed, while the institution around them fell to the New Paradigm, until the papacy was the only thing left.\nOne of the things I’ve been saying is a blessing in disguise, and an enormous relief, about the Bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the Wojtyla\/Ratzinger era.\nWe were expected for all those years to pretend we were in the “New Springtime of Vatican II,” while we watched these wolves in shepherds’ clothing eating the sheep.\nNow we

then remember how the pope had apologised-except-not-really because the accusations are, after all, still lies, and that there’s still “no evidence” against Barros…?\nThe press, secular as well as Catholic, is full this week of the story that the pope did indeed see evidence of Barros’ complicity in Karadima’s sexual abuse – not only that Barros had helped to cover it up but that he had been present and a direct witness at the time and therefore a passive participant.\nNicole Winfield and the Associated Press dropped the bomb that the information came directly from the victims, whom Francis had dismissed and refused to meet with on his trip, and delivered through his own Commission on sexual abuse:\nPope Francis received a victim’s letter in 2015 that graphically detailed how a priest sexually abused him and how other Chilean clergy ignored it, contradicting the pope’s recent insistence that no victims had come forward to denounce the cover-up, the letter’s author and members of Francis’ own sex- abuse commission have told The Associated Press.\n\nThe fact that Francis received the eight-page letter, obtained by the AP, challenges his insistence that he has “zero tolerance” for sex abuse and cover-ups.\nIt also calls into question his stated empathy with abuse survivors, compounding the most serious crisis of his five-year papacy.\nNow it appears that Francis had also overruled a 2015 warning from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that Barros should not be made a bishop.\nThe Italian Catholic daily La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana reports that not only did the pope see a letter from victims, but that the CDF, under Muller, “had already conducted an preliminary investigation into Barros and the other bishops close to Karadima which had led to the decision to relieve them of their duties.”\n“But with a letter signed by the Pope in January 2015 and sent to the Chilean bishops, the request for exemption is blocked and shortly thereafter Barros is promoted to…Osorno.”\nThe article points out that while Karadima was convicted by a Vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victims, it is the same testimony of the same victim-witnesses that Francis now dismisses in the accusations against Barros.\nThe accusations that stood against Karadima come from the same sources as those against Barros, who the victims said was in the room watching at the time.\nWhile the specifics are still not known, readers may be reminded by this of a peculiar incident about a year later in which Pope Francis summarily ordered the dismissal of three priests of the CDF, whose remit was investigations of clerics accused of sexual abuse.\nThe website One Peter Five reports, via Marco Tosatti, that the pope ordered their removal without offering any explanation to then-cardinal prefect Gerhard Muller.\nWhen, after several attempts and three months later[2], Muller was able to get an audience with the pope to ask the reason, he received the response, “I am the pope, I do not need to give reasons for any of my decisions.\nI have decided that they have to leave and they have to leave.”\nMarco Tosatti reports the CDF incident, but it follows an odd story of a meeting of curial officials to discuss certain bishop appointments.\nWithout naming names, (or, frustratingly, giving dates[3]) Tosatti relates:\n“It was some time ago to make a bishop, not in Italy.\nThe nuncio has prepared the triad [the “terna” or list of three candidates].\nA cardinal, head of the dicastery, perhaps the same holder of the Congregation for Bishops, during the ordinary assembly took the floor, saying: ‘The first candidate indicated is excellent, the second is good.\nBut I would like to warn of the third, whom I know well, since he was a seminarian, and who presents problems both on the level of doctrine and morality.\nHe responds little to the necessary criteria.\nBut the third was a friend of someone and another cardinal, of the circle currently in power, has flung himself at his colleague, accusing him of impropriety.’ The meeting ended without further decisions.”\nWhatever the details of these strange incidents, what is clear in Chile is that no amount of eyewitness testimony was going to make the slightest difference.\nBergoglio wanted Barros as a bishop and that was that.\nEven while “apologising” the pope had doubled down when questioned about it by journalists, saying, “You, in all good will, tell me that there are victims, but I haven’t seen any, because they haven’t come forward.”\n“In the case of Barros it’s been observed, it’s been studied; there’s no evidence.\nThe best thing to do if someone believes it’s the case is to come forward quickly with evidence.”\nThe AP report, however, says exactly the opposite; that members of his own (now defunct[4]) abuse Commission had approached Cardinal O’Malley, the pope’s “top abuse advisor,” with the letter to deliver to the pope.\nMarie Collins, the Irish abuse survivor and Commission member who resigned, citing the Vatican’s refusal to take meaningful action, told AP, “When we gave him [O’Malley] the letter for the pope, he assured us he would give it to the pope and speak of the concerns.\nAnd at a later date, he assured us that that had been done.” Juan Carlos Cruz, the Karadima victim whose membership on the Commission the Vatican had blocked, told AP, “Cardinal O’Malley called me after the pope’s visit here in Philadelphia and he told me, among other things, that he had given the letter to the pope – in his hands.”\nOn the face of it, there are only a few logical possibilities here.\nIn fact, unless Cardinal O’Malley – who has, as of this writing, remained silent – comes forward and says that he didn’t hand the letter over pope, there is really only one; that the pope lied.\nAnd this is what is now being said quite openly by a vast array of voices, secular and Catholic, left and right.\nAs Winfield writes,\n“The revelation could be costly for Francis, whose track record on the abuse crisis was already shaky after a botched Italian abuse case he intervened in became public[5].\nMore recently, he let the abuse commission lapse at the end of last year.\nVatican analysts now openly question whether he ‘gets it,’ and some of his own advisers privately acknowledge that maybe he doesn’t.”\n“No evidence…” Lie big, lie often, and when caught, keep lying.\nOne of the many things these secular reporters seem not to be paying attention to is that “no evidence” is in fact a well-rehearsed, stock response for Bergoglio.\nHe said almost exactly the same in 2013 when confronted about another predatory homosexual he was sheltering.\nThe hoopla surrounding the “Who am I to judge” comment tends to obscure the context of the comment.\nIt was made in response to a question by a journalist about Monsignore Battista Ricca – a prelate whose promiscuous homosexuality is so well known it was covered by the Telegraph as early as July 2013.\nIlze Scamparini asked the pope about Ricca, saying, “What you intend to do about this?\nHow are you confronting this issue and how does Your Holiness intend to confront the whole question of the gay lobby?”\nWhat reply did Bergoglio give?\nHis standard one: “No evidence.”\nAbout Monsignor Ricca: I did what canon law calls for, that is a preliminary investigation.\nAnd from this investigation, there was nothing of what had been alleged.\nWe did not find anything of that.\nThis is the response.”\nHe added, “In this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn’t find anything.”\nBut Ricca’s activities, for which the pope claimed there was no evidence, were notorious.\nThey include being caught in flagrante in an elevator with a teenaged male prostitute, and his sexual relationship with a captain in the Swiss army.\nSo flagrant was Ricca’s behaviour that it took intervention by Uruguay’s nuncio to have him removed.\nIt was reported in 1999 and 2000 by L’Espresso, who said the information was confirmed by “numerous bishops, priests, religious and laity” in Uruguay[6].\nIn fact, the evidence shows that Ricca is completely in line with Bergoglio’s normal procedures.\nAs “Marcantonio Colonna” wrote in the Dictator Pope, “In fact his patronage of Monsignor Ricca fits the pattern which was well established when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires, whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb.”\nIt was at this early “no evidence” comment on the plane home from Rio that some of those paying attention started to understand that Bergoglio’s policy is in line with that of certain leaders of the past who recommended that if a politician was going to lie, he should lie big and lie brazenly.\nAnd in case anyone was wondering what will happen next, the same advice said to keep on lying after you’re caught.\nThe pattern of silence and, when pressed, flat-out denial has been Bergoglio’s policy since long before he came on the international scene.\nHe has a long record in Argentina of shaving close to scandals and vociferously denying involvement, and relying heavily on the broad good will of Catholics towards bishops to pull it off.\nPerhaps his biggest error with Barros was failing to understand just how little of that capital of trust there is left in the Catholic world as a whole.\nIndeed, on the subject of priests sexually abusing young people, it could only be measured in the negative numbers.\n“Argentine Victims Who Tried to Meet with Pope Francis…”\nThough the website Bishop Accountability is blatantly anti-clerical, their data is unassailable since most of it comes from information that is already public.\nOn their Argentina page is a long list of accusations that Bergoglio\/Francis simply isn’t interested in hearing from victims.\n“In Pope Francis’s 21 years as bishop and archbishop of Buenos Aires, the Wall Street Journal reports, including the years when he headed the Argentine bishops’ conference, he declined to meet with victims of sexual abuse.”\n\n“All of them tried to contact the cardinal archbishop in 2002 or later,” the same period when Pope Benedict and other bishops were striving to meet with victims and demonstrate an interest in the problem.\nThe site says that “in addition to Bergoglio’s failure to respond to victims, the public record contains no evidence that he released any information about abusers.”\nIn fact, he went so far as to flatly deny there had been any instances of abuse in his archdiocese.\nWeeks after his election to the papacy, he was quoted by his close friend, Rabbi Abraham Skorka, “In my diocese it never happened to me, but a bishop called me once by phone to ask me what to do in a situation like this.” Francis added that he agreed with the “zero tolerance” attitude of the Irish episcopate and admired Pope Benedict’s reforms – most of which he was later to quietly reverse.\nIt was at exactly this time, however, that victims from Argentina were attempting to get the new pope’s attention.\nOne, known to the press only as “Gabriel,” wanted to talk to Francis about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of Julio César Grassi, accused of molesting at least five boys, “who has been avoiding the sentences of the justice of Morón and the Court of Cassation.\nSo far, judges and prosecutors at all instances found him guilty.”\nIn case anyone thinks the Grassi-Gabriel case was not serious enough for the pope’s attention, Bishop Accountability summarises, “A year after Gabriel had filed criminal charges [2003] but before the start of Grassi’s trial, three men ransacked the survivor’s apartment and beat him.” These men threatened to kill him if he did not retract his testimony and quit the case.\nTen years [after Gabriel filed criminal charges], in May 2013, with Grassi still free despite his conviction in 2009, “Gabriel and his attorney, Juan Pablo Gallego, brought a two-page letter addressed to Pope Francis to the office of the papal nuncio in Buenos Aires.\nAn employee refused to accept the letter after learning of its topic and threatened to call security if Gabriel and Gallego did not leave the premises.”\nThe group surmises that it was Bergoglio’s direct intervention with judges in the case that prevented a conviction against Grassi for so long and delayed his sentencing through multiple appeals.\nIn 2006, then-Archbishop Bergoglio complained of a “media campaign” and claimed that the Grassi case was “different” from other accusations.\nDuring his criminal trial Grassi said Bergoglio “never let go” of his hand.\nIn 2009, Grassi was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault and corruption in the case of “Gabriel,” who was aged 13 at the time of the abuse, but the appeals dragged on until he was finally sent to prison in September 2013.\nSeveral more similar cases, all of whom were rebuffed in their attempts to meet with Bergoglio, are detailed here, for the strong-of-stomach.\nA virtuoso performance-liar\nLooking back and carefully examining his record, Jorge Bergoglio’s mastery of using the weaknesses of morally compromised men is becoming evident.\nIt is arguable that even the members of the so-called “San Gallen Mafia” who apparently conspired to put him on Peter’s throne were used by him.\nBut he is also a master of judging an audience and telling them what they expect to hear; a key skill for all grifters and confidence tricksters.\nLooking carefully at the infamous “Who am I to judge” comment, this was clear early on.\nThe first part of that interview is a blatant and enormous lie, and it was from there that the pope moved on to his apology for homosexuality in general.\nRecall that this was the very first airplane interview, on the trip back to Rome from World Youth Day in Rio, a matter of weeks after his election.\nAt the time, the papal apologists sprang instantly into action and we heard all about how the pope was talking strictly within the boundaries of Catholic doctrine.\nBut perhaps in hindsight, we are ready to examine the full implications of his little speech, one that was clearly well-rehearsed.\n(Don’t forget, no question is asked in a papal interview without being thoroughly vetted ahead of time.\nJournalists must submit their questions well in advance.)\nThis was the pope laying out his policy regarding homosexuality, a policy for which he was duly rewarded by being lauded on the cover of the homosexualist lobby’s US trade magazine.\nRead his full answer carefully:\nI see that many times in the Church, over and above this case, but including this case, people search for “sins from youth”, for example, and then publish them.\nThey are not crimes, right?\nCrimes are something different: the abuse of minors is a crime.\nNo, sins.\n\nBut if a person, whether it be a lay person, a priest or a religious sister, commits a sin and then converts, the Lord forgives, and when the Lord forgives, the Lord forgets and this is very important for our lives.\nWhen we confess our sins and we truly say, “I have sinned in this”, the Lord forgets, and so we have no right not to forget, because otherwise we would run the risk of the Lord not forgetting our sins.\nThat is a danger.\n\nThis is important: a theology of sin.\nMany times I think of Saint Peter.\nHe committed one of the worst sins, that is he denied Christ, and even with this sin they made him Pope.\nWe have to think a great deal about that.\n\nBut, returning to your question more concretely.\nIn this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn’t find anything.\nThis is the first question.\nThen, you spoke about the gay lobby.\nSo much is written about the gay lobby.\nI still haven’t found anyone with an identity card in the Vatican with “gay” on it.\nThey say there are some there.\n\nI believe that when you are dealing with such a person, you must distinguish between the fact of a person being gay and the fact of someone forming a lobby, because not all lobbies are good.\nThis one is not good.\n\nIf someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him?\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this in a beautiful way, saying ... wait a moment, how does it say it ... it says: “no one should marginalize these people for this, they must be integrated into society”.\nThe problem is not having this tendency, no, we must be brothers and sisters to one another, and there is this one and there is that one.\nThe problem is in making a lobby of this tendency: a lobby of misers, a lobby of politicians, a lobby of masons, so many lobbies.\nFor me, this is the greater problem.\nThank you so much for asking this question.\nMany thanks.\nOne of the pope’s favourite rhetorical techniques is a combination of Begging the Question and conspiracy.\nHe starts by assuming, without any effort at defence or explanation, a point that concedes the whole issue.\nThis was the first time a pope had ever used the political term “gay”.\nNot “homosexual,” not “same-sex attracted,” but “gay,” meaning that he started by adopting the entirety of the homosexualist movement’s linguistic manipulations.\nLanguage counts in politics, and a pope using that term means he is by implication starting the discussion – and his pontificate – by aligning himself with the basic tenets of a movement that is violently opposed to Catholic moral teaching, and in direct opposition to his immediate, and still living, predecessor.\nIn this case too, he was addressing a plane load of journalists who were either secular themselves, or for the most part are the kind of Catholic who believes it is fine to “disagree” with Catholic teaching on sexuality.\nThere are very few “conservative” Catholics in the Vatican journalist pool.\nThis means that his use of this language was a conspiratorial wink and nod to his immediate audience, a sly message to say, “People talk all the time about a gay lobby, but you and I both know this is mostly nonsense, propaganda from those people… those conservatives…We cool and hip people don’t hate gays, do we?”\nThis astonishing departure follows an implied but very clear assertion that Ricca has repented and given up his activity, an assertion that has absolutely no evidence to back it up.\nWe are simply asked to take the pope’s word for it, but given that it follows his astoundingly brazen lie that there was no evidence for Ricca’s homosexual activity in the first place, we can take the assurance for what it seems to be worth.\nNext, after another little inside nudge-nudge-wink-wink joke about the “gay lobby” – implying (but of course never outright saying) that the whole thing is hysterical nonsense – we hear a direct contradiction to Catholic teaching from no less a source than his predecessor, Pope Benedict Ratzinger.\n“The problem is not having this tendency.” Well, actually, your holiness, yes it is, particularly in the case of priests.\nThe “tendency” is called in the same catechism you quote “intrinsically disordered” and Ratzinger was very clear that this “tendency” is a sign of a serious emotional dysfunction that “must” preclude a man from being ordained.\nSquandering the capital of trust\nA few months ago in a piece for the Remnant, I talked about why the Church (and nearly all human societies) regard lying as a sin:\nA mistake many make about lying is to understand it only in terms of morality.\nBut Thomas makes the point that it is first a matter of metaphysics.\nLying is an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality.\nThomistic theology teaches that it is by lying that we become most like the devil, and most unlike God, because we are trying to change the nature of reality to suit our own purposes.\nHabitual lying in effect changes you into a different kind of being, one that is by nature an opponent of Truth, ordered against Truth.\nThis of course means that a person whose “orientation,” as we might say, is towards falsehood, even when he is at any given moment saying something true, is still servicing his lies.\nHe tells the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality.\nIt was not by violence, but by lying and manipulation, by issuing half-truths and pretending to be the kind of man he was not, that Shakespeare’s character Iago earned the title of most evil character in English literature.\nHuman beings are naturally ordered towards the truth, and we have to work at assuming a lie.\nThis is why confidence tricksters can be successful, why lying works for getting what you want; people don’t see it coming.\nThe first natural assumption is trust, at least at the basic level of expecting truth most of the time.\nWe therefore instinctively see lying as a betrayal of trust.\nConsidering how much trust the Catholic faithful had in the papacy until about 1965, how much un-earned trust Francis started with just by being elected, this pontificate should be remembered as one of the great confidence scams in history.\nBelieving Catholics have watched aghast as this pope has habitually trampled on every aspect of Catholic teaching.\nSandro Magister recently published a piece on his website that listed in dizzying detail the many times, in only the last few months, that pope Francis has falsified with obvious intention, the words of Christ in Scripture and the teaching of the Church.\nOf course this would be of little interest to secular journalists, who have paid no mind to his habit of rewriting Catholicism, but the sex abuse crisis is something secular journalists are very interested in, a fact Bergoglio seems not to have understood.\nIt is now irrefutable that Pope Bergoglio is a habitual liar – that in fact truth, like reality, seems to mean nothing to him except as a tool.\nSociologists talk about the concept of the “high trust society,” one in which citizens believe what they are told by the elites and trust them to govern and protect them adequately.\nThey warn that the general loss of trust in institutions leads to a general state of chaos, in which laws on the books matter little as citizens turn to their last resort of protecting themselves and their own families.\nThis is the way societies disintegrate.\nIt has been said many times that the sex abuse crisis has created a massive loss of trust in prelates among the Catholic faithful, and this is true.\nWith a professional confidence trickster on the papal throne, blatantly using lies and manipulation to maintain power and ram through an agenda at radical variance with Catholic doctrine, how long before that predictable disintegration occurs?\nAre we seeing it already?\nAre we seeing it in the declarations of this or that episcopate on Amoris Laetitia and Communion for divorced and civilly remarried Catholics?\nWith Cardinal Marx and others promoting “blessings” for “same-sex unions” are we going to be seeing an escalation of it?\nI have seen a veritable chorus of Catholics on social media declaring that if Paul VI is canonised, their loss of faith in the Church as an institution will be complete.\nI am told from contacts inside the Vatican that after the trip to Chile Bergoglio’s support has completely dried up.\nHe has no more resources of trust even among the people he has chosen to surround himself with and after the reports of Cardinal Sandri going toe-to-toe with him in a shouting match, it seems that perhaps even his legendary vicious temper tantrums are failing to have the desired effect of terrorising his subordinates into submission.\nMarie Collins, by no stretch even a “conservative” Catholic, echoed this concern, saying the Barros affair has “definitely undermined credibility, trust, and hope” in Francis.\n“All I can say is that people who had a lot of hope in this particular pope, and I am talking about just ordinary Catholics that I know in my own parish, would find it very difficult now…and cannot understand and cannot believe that this particular pope has said the things he has said in the last few weeks,” she told the National Catholic Reporter.\nIt may seem like a moment to enjoy, seeing the apparently unbreachable shell of papal teflon finally cracking, but in reality this situation is potentially very harmful for souls in the long run.\nThere is a multitude of problems this pontificate has created or made worse that we will be dealing with for a long time after Bergoglio is gone, but perhaps one of the bigger ones will be the destruction of trust.\nAlready fractured since the collapse of all Catholic institutions after Vatican II and the horrors of the sex abuse crisis, how much will there be to repair of the once-steadfast trust Catholics instinctively had in the Church after this?\nNotes:\n[1] “Not one victim has come forward in Chile; show me the proof.\nThis is slander and calumny.\nIs that clear?”\n[2] The book “The Dictator Pope” relates that regular meetings between the pope and dicastery heads have been abolished and even high-ranking curia prefects are often unable to see the pope, whose appointments are now completely controlled by the Secretariat of State.\nIt is certainly clear that no one sees the pope unless Cardinal Parolin approves, which may be the reason Cardinal Zen, in his efforts to warn Francis of the dangers of a Vatican deal with the communist Chinese government had to wait in the rain at a Wednesday general audience.\n[3] This is common in Italian journalism that has somewhat different standards from that of the Anglo world… and drives the rest of us spare.\nItalians care about getting a general picture of what’s going on, where Anglo-Saxons are considered weirdly obsessed with trivial details.\n[4] Though she never blamed the pope, Marie Collins complained that Vatican officialdom had simply not implemented the Commission’s recommendations.\nThe time limit of the Commission’s members was allowed to lapse without renewal and though it was not dissolved formally the Commission has ceased to function with no word of any plan to revive it.\n[5] Probably a reference to the Inzoli case in which Francis overturned a previous sentence of a Vatican tribunal after the priest – now laicised – approached some of the pope’s close advisors for help, including Cardinal Coccopalmerio.\n[6] Not that anyone in Rome was trying very hard.\nSandro Magister reported after the “Who am I to judge” comment, “Before the appointment, Francis had been shown, as is customary, the personal file on Ricca, in which he had not found anything unseemly.\nHe had also heard from various personalities of the curia, and none of them had raised objections.”\n>","completion":"

Mollie Hemingway explaining:\nOur relationship with Russia is at a significant low point where just having some conversations can lead us to a better outcome.\nAnd there are so many important things that they are involved with that we care about, whether it’s Syria, Ukraine, North Korea or nuclear arms.\nI’m kind of surprised there’s been this much angst over this press conference.\nNot that he said things the way he should have.\nPresident Trump really did mess up with that press conference but I don’t quite know what people want.\nHe actually is pretty tough on Russia.\nAnd in the last couple of years, we’ve seen an increase in the military budget, we’ve seen an increase in the intelligence budget.\nWe are doing NATO exercises in the Baltics.\nWe provided legal aid to Ukraine and Georgia.\nWe’re developing low-yield nuclear weapons.\nHe implemented sanctions that were even stronger than required by Congressional mandate.\nSo if you care about actual actions, I think there’s a lot to be happy about in terms of a tough posture towards Russia.\nPeople are obsessed about words and they should maybe focus on the actions as well.\nFormer Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, concurred with Hemingway arguing that by any standard Trump has been far tougher on Russia than Obama was.\nFirst, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016.\nThe very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America.\nIt was their duty in 2016 – not candidate Trump’s.\nSecond, the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being.\nThe Trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior.\nThe Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia.\nAlso, President Trump’s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy.\nFurthermore, President Trump’s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin.\nThe stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has.\nBeyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia: Where President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression.\nWhen the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain, President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States.\nWhen the Russians retaliated, the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle.\nPresident Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York.\nMore than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons.\nDespite the hysteria of the left, it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia.\nNothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime.\nAny intellectually honest review of the last decade of foreign policy would lead one to admit that President Trump has most assuredly been tougher on Putin and Russia than Obama ever was.\nArticle posted with permission from Constitution.com\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"A colossal Neptunian storm just vanished before our eyes\n\nYou don’t have to look far for fresh news about Mars, Saturn, or Jupiter these days, but Neptune doesn’t always get the same kind of attention.\nThe big frigid blue ball is the farthest planet from the Sun — since we don’t count Pluto as a planet anymore — and it hasn’t been studied with the same intensity of many of the others.\nThankfully the Hubble Space Telescope hasn’t lost interest in the distant planet, because it just captured one of Neptunes massive storms losing steam as it roars across the planet.\nStorms on Neptune appear as giant dark ovals, a bit like Jupiter’s Great Red Spot.\nHowever, unlike Jupiter’s centuries-old storm, Neptune’s hurricane-like weather events only last a few years at a time before eventually dissipating.\nOf course, that’s not to say the storms are insignificant — many are large enough to swallow and entire continent here on Earth — so watching one breathe its dying gasps is still a special sight.\nThe planet, which NASA says is the windiest in our Solar System, hosts regular storms which appear as large spots on its surface, but scientists are still at a loss as to how they actually occur.\n“We have no evidence of how these vortices are formed or how fast they rotate,” Agustín Sánchez-Lavega of the University of the Basque Country in Spain explains.\n“It is most likely that they arise from an instability in the sheared eastward and westward winds.”\nThe observation of this particular storm dying out is significant because it’s the very first time one of Neptune’s storms has been observed in such a way.\nIt also goes against everything that scientists thought they knew about how forms on Neptune live and die.\n“It looks like we’re capturing the demise of this dark vortex, and it’s different from what well-known studies led us to expect,” said Michael H. Wong of the University of California at Berkeley says.\n“Their dynamical simulations said that anticyclones under Neptune’s wind shear would probably drift toward the equator.\nWe thought that once the vortex got too close to the equator, it would break up and perhaps create a spectacular outburst of cloud activity.”\nBut this storm stayed its course, dying out in a horizontal path that didn’t bring it towards the Neptunian equator at all, forcing scientists to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new theory on the planet’s weather habits.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|949|972."}
{"prompt":"Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan\n\nOne of the biggest stories of 2017 and 2018 is being ignored by the mainstream media and we all know why that is.\nIt's because it implicates dozens of House Democrats in what could be the biggest crime of spying in US history by Muslim IT spy Imran Awan and his partners.\nFormer head of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is on the front line of aiding and abetting Awan and his associates as has been revealed by Luke Rosiak of The Daily Caller.\nIn a lengthy report by Rosiak at The Daily Caller News Foundation, he writes:\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat

anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nEx-Democratic National Committee head Debbie Wasserman Schultz said she intervened in a Pakistani land deal involving her then–IT aide Imran Awan, according to two House employees.\nThe dispute came after Awan’s father was charged with fraud in relation to the deal, and the mysterious exertion of political influence resulted in Pakistani authorities instead targeting the elderly alleged victims, according to a local report.\nAnd when a House Office of Inspector General cybersecurity investigation found that Awan made “unauthorized access” to House servers, including the House Democratic Caucus’ shortly before the election, Wasserman Schultz became “frantic, not normal,” “making the rounds” to House officials in an attempt to kill the investigation, one House employee told The Daily Caller News Foundation.\nAwan told people Wasserman Schultz chose the name for his daughter, Leza — a Jewish name — and that the Florida congresswoman’s daughter regularly rode a horse that Awan kept at a boarding facility, sources with knowledge of the relationship told TheDCNF.\nWasserman Schultz cornered House Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko and called him a “fucking Islamophobe,” saying “you will not so much as take away their parking spots,” the two House employees said Kiko told them.\nThe congresswoman also told Kiko she had invited Awan’s whole family to her daughter’s bat mitzvah and said she had “helped him with a land deal,” the sources said.\nA spokesman for Kiko declined to comment on this story.\nA 2009 article in the Pakistani publication Dawn, headlined “Influential expat shields father from long arm of law,” said Awan’s father was facing criminal fraud charges involving a land deal, but Awan used political connections to pressure the police into targeting the alleged victims instead.\nAwan’s father purchased “huge chunks of land from different farmers in 2008,” but all the checks bounced, the report said.\n“The police high-ups are ‘ominously’ indifferent to proceed against Awan,” and it’s “noteworthy” how they were “complying with the desires of” Awan, who the paper described as a “White House employee.”\n“About a dozen farmers of Chak 7-JB, Panjor, including five siblings — all aged between 57 and 70 — have given up hope of justice after they sold their agricultural lands to Ashraf Awan of Bole De Jhugi, who is father of White House employee Shahid Imran,” Dawn reported.\nImran Awan also goes by Shahid Imran Awan, Virginia court records show.\nThe police harassed the 19 would-be victims, including the five elderly brothers and even their lawyer, and charged them with “frivolous” cases, apparently to get them to stop trying to get the money they say they were owed, the paper said.\n“Mohammad Abid, a victim of [Ashraf] Awan’s alleged high-profile swindling, said that [Ashraf] Awan’s son had easy access to the corridors of power and that’s why he was able to [pressure] the police to dance to his tunes,” Dawn reported.\nThe article details a series of people who say they were then subject to retaliation, including widow Bushra Bibi who said, “now Imran was threatening her with dire consequences.”\nA third source, who’s familiar with Imran Awan, told TheDCNF that Awan recounted the intervention in the foreign criminal matter and that Awan said it was Wasserman Schultz who intervened.\nA fourth source — a fellow House IT aide — previously told TheDCNF that Awan said now-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel wasinvolved.\nDr. Zafar Iqbal, one of the alleged victims, told TheDCNF that “Imran came to Pakistan to get [his father] out of jail, since he had some [connections] in the Congress.”\nAshraf Awan’s business partner in the land deal, Rashid Minhas, told TheDCNF that the elder Awan gave a USB to a Pakistani senator who is a former head of a Pakistani intelligence agency, and that Imran claimed his IT position in Congress gave him the power to “change the U.S. president.” Minhas is in prison for an unrelated fraud charge.\nOn July 25, 2016, the House Inspector General notified the Committee on House Administration that investigators had detected major cybersecurity violations by the Awan family.\nAwan, his wife, two brothers, his brother’s wife, and even his elderly father were all being paid by various Democrats to manage their servers, with many of the members from Wasserman Schultz’s Florida.\nThe finding came at a critical time for Democrats: It was three days after WikiLeaks published the first emails from a hacked on the DNC, setting the stage for Wasserman Schultz to lose her position as party chair and for Democrats to begin electioneering on a theme of Russian hacking.\nIn February 2017, Kiko and the House’s top law enforcement official, Paul Irving, outlined serious violations in a letter to the committee, and the family was banned from the House computer network.\nThe letter also noted that the House Democratic Caucus server disappeared soon after the IG report named it as key evidence.\nBut Wasserman Schultz refused to fire Awan, with her spokesman saying he would work on “websites” and “printers,” which a cybersecurity expert previously told TheDCNF would presumably involve network access.\nThe congresswoman also added Awan’s wife, Hina Alvi, to her payroll in late 2016, after the investigation was in full swing, but before the family was banned from the network.\nWasserman Schultz kept paying her until March 17 — 12 days after Alvi went to Pakistan with $12,000 in a suitcase.\nHer actions so rattled the Administration Committee’s Democratic staff director, Jamie Fleet, that he planted a negative story in Politico that revealed Wasserman Schultz, his fellow Democrat, was continuing to pay the suspect, two House sources said.\nThe story also said Wasserman Schultz had a “friendly personal relationship” with Awan and Alvi.\nFleet did not respond to a request for comment.\nKiko said in an April 2018 hearing spurred by the scandal that he was powerless to stop members who refused to fire a bad actor.\n“Termination, now it’s the member’s responsibility … We can revoke everything but they could still be employed,” he said.\nHe added that his office should have the authority to override members who would want to keep a rule-breaker on the government network.\nWasserman Schultz became fixated on finding out everything investigators knew about Awan, the House sources said.\nHouse investigators briefed her extensively with significant evidence about Awan and his family, including improper computer evidence.\nYet Wasserman Schultz said in a statement, “my office was provided no evidence to indicate that laws had been broken, which over time, raised troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling.”\nWasserman Schultz was defending someone investigators allegedly told her was suspected of cybersecurity violations, despite having resigned from her position as DNC head following a devastating hack during the 2016 election.\nDespite Wasserman Schultz’s relationship with Awan, in April 2017 — two months after he was banned from the computer network — the IT aide appeared to put the congresswoman at risk.\nCapitol Police found a laptop with the username RepDWS in a phone booth at midnight along with a copy of Awan’s ID, a letter to prosecutors and a note that said “attorney client privilege,” according to a police report.\nAwan’s ID caused police to tie it to a criminal suspect and seize it, but the note kept them from looking at it.\nThat led to a tense exchange recorded on video in May 2017, in which Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the Capitol Police with “consequences” for not returning the laptop.\nWhen he refused, she mulled attempting to restructuring the Capitol Police’s entire board so that her committee would have more leverage over it.\nHouse sources told TheDCNF these exchanges were only a public glimpse into numerous such interactions, which were frequently profane, with every official she could buttonhole.\nOne source said she also went to the Department of Justice and “made a stink.”\nWasserman Schultz hired the House’s former top lawyer, Bill Pittard — who had recently quit the House — to try to block prosecutors from seeing evidence, TheDCNF previously reported.Awan obtained legal representation from two lawyers who began their careers in Miami — one with experience in espionage cases and the other a former aide to Hillary Clinton.\nWasserman Schultz’ district includes much of Miami.\nOne of Awan’s lawyers told a judge he felt “very strongly” that prosecutors should not be able to look at the RepDWS laptop, mounting an attorney-client privilege argument.\nProsecutors did not challenge the argument before the judge.\nIn August 2017, Imran and Hina were charged with four felony counts for gathering up money under allegedly false circumstances before wiring $300,000 to Pakistan in January.\nProsecutors said the timing suggests that the Awans had learned of their investigation, which a spokeswoman for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, AshLee Strong, told TheDCNF was supposed to be secret.\nCapitol Police “requested that the shared employees be allowed to continue to use their IT credentials until February [2017] because they didn’t want to tip off the employees,” she said.\nWasserman Schultz’s brother is a prosecutor in the same office handling the case and has tweeted about it.\nGowen said

{"prompt":"Ramadan Jihad 2018 Death Toll So Far Is 218\n\nAnother Ramadan is upon us, and the jihad death toll so far stands at 218 Infidels, murdered in 53 jihad attacks.\nOnce again this year we see that Ramadan is quintessentially the month of jihad.\nA jihad group explained it back in 2012: “The month of Ramadan is a month of holy war and death for Allah.\nIt is a month for fighting the enemies of Allah and God’s messenger, the Jews and their American facilitators.” Referring to a jihad attack that happened at that time, the message continued: “One of our groups aided by Allah managed to bomb a bus full of Jewish tourists, plunderers of holy lands, after careful tracking.\nThe holy war is not confined to a particular arena and we shall fight the Jews and the Americans until they leave the land of Islam.”\nIn contrast, President Trump issued a statement claiming that “Ramadan reminds us of the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life.”\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\n* Dianne Feinstein Maxine Waters Adam Schiff Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand Keith Ellison Cory Booker\nEmail *\nComments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nSo which is it?\nDoes Ramadan remind us of “the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life,” or is Ramadan “a month of calamity everywhere for nonbelievers”?\nIslam’s core beliefs make it clear that the latter statement is closer to the truth.\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims are exhorted to renew and deepen their devotion to Allah.\nHence it is a time when they’re supposed to grow more generous and kind toward their fellow Muslims.\nHowever, the Qur’an says: “Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves” (48:29).\nIf the Ramadan imperative is to become more devout, the Muslim who applies himself diligently to the Ramadan observance will simultaneously become more both merciful to his fellow Muslims and more severe against the unbelievers.\nMurdering infidels thus doesn’t contradict the spirit of Ramadan; it embodies it.\nThe Kavkaz Center, a website operated by Chechen jihadists, explained in a 2010 article that the idea of Ramadan as a time for warfare against infidels went back to Muhammad’s time: “The month of Ramadan in the life of the Prophet (pbuh) and the righteous ancestors was a month of forthcoming.\nThe greatest battles during the lifetime of the Prophet (pbuh) occurred in this blessed month, the month of jihad, zeal and enthusiasm.”\nTrump was, unfortunately, following the example of his two immediate predecessors when he claimed that “Ramadan reminds us of the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life,” and was severely misleading the American people.\nIronically, even in doing this he is likely to fail to satisfy Muslims, or anyone.\nAfter all, after the Trump White House issued a similar statement last year, the Washington Post ran a lengthy piece in which several Muslims explained why the statement was unsatisfactory to them.\nShadi Hamid of the Qatar-funded Brookings Institution declared: “Trump has so rarely recognized that American Muslims even exist, but this offers apparent proof that he is aware of our existence.\nGreat!\nPutting all that context aside, it’s offensive and pretty much terrible.”\nWhy?\nBecause Trump had the temerity to mention jihad terrorism.\nHamid continued: “We, as American Muslims, shouldn’t be defined solely in our relationship to bad things that we have nothing to do with.\nWe’re also normal people who happen to be Muslim and to see us and our history in America so narrowly is plain out offensive.”\nWhat is actually offensive is that Hamid would try in this way to absolve the Muslim community of any responsibility to root out jihad terrorist from its midst.\nThere is certain to be more jihad terrorism during this Ramadan, and some of it may be committed by Muslims in the U.S. Hamid, if he cared about this, would be confronting honestly the teachings of Islam that make Ramadan the month of jihad, and working to reform them.\nMeanwhile, it would be dangerous, suicidal folly for Infidels to pretend that Ramadan is not the month of jihad.\nAnd as our Ramadan willful blindness continues, more Infidels will die.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|602|643\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|724|800\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|4492|4664\nName_Calling,Labeling|435|456\nLoaded_Language|3122|3141\nName_Calling,Labeling|0|13\nCausal_Oversimplification|192|238\nLoaded_Language|317|345\nLoaded_Language|557|571\nLoaded_Language|916|955\nLoaded_Language|1638|1677\nCausal_Oversimplification|1745|1828\nLoaded_Language|2107|2121\nLoaded_Language|2368|2387\nCausal_Oversimplification|2405|2485\nName_Calling,Labeling|2528|2545\nRepetition|2630|2638\nName_Calling,Labeling|2856|2894\nRepetition|3069|3111\nFlag-Waving|3122|3161\nLoaded_Language|3640|3645\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|3509|3638\nLoaded_Language|4028|4047\nLoaded_Language|3698|3718\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|4050|4209\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|4331|4479\nLoaded_Language|4504|4542\nLoaded_Language|4613|4630\nName_Calling,Labeling|2415|2423\nName_Calling,Labeling|4647|4655\nName_Calling,Labeling|4534|4542\nName_Calling,Labeling|119|127."}
{"prompt":"Al Franken Is Just The Beginning As The Curtain Is Pulled Back In Washington DC\n\nAl Franken Is Just The Beginning As The Curtain Is Pulled Back In Washington DC\nPlease help support us with cryptocurrency donations.\nThank you!\nFor decades, Americans have known that very sick things happen behind the scenes in Washington D.C., but the mainstream media nearly really talks about any of it.\nBut now the curtain is starting to be pulled back, and the revelations about Al Franken are just the beginning.\nEarlier this week, I wrote an article about how “sexual harassment is rampant in the halls of Congress”, and that was before a female radio anchor named LeeAnn Tweeden revealed that Al Franken had “forcibly kissed” and groped her during a USO tour in 2006.\nThe following comes from an article in which Tweeden shared her story…\nI couldn’t believe it.\nHe groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep.\nI felt violated all over again.\nEmbarrassed.\nBelittled.\nHumiliated.\nHow dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it’s funny?\nI told my husband everything that happened and showed him the picture.\nI wanted to shout my story to the world with a megaphone to anyone who would listen, but even as angry as I was, I was worried about the potential backlash and damage going public might have on my career as a broadcaster.\nBut that was then, this is now.\nI’m no longer afraid.\nWhen the story initially broke, Franken rushed to issue an apology…\n“I certainly don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,” said Franken.\n“As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn’t.\nI shouldn’t have done it.”\nNeedless to say, many were completely unsatisfied with Franken’s very weak statement.\nIn fact, some members of his own party said that his apology was entirely insufficient and are calling for Franken to be held accountable for his actions…\nGuy Cecil, the former head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and now the boss of a leading Democratic super PAC, voiced his frustration with the inadequacy of Franken’s apology on Twitter.\n“That was not an apology and was an insufficient response to serious allegations,” Cecil tweeted.\n“Al Franken must be held accountable if our party wants to live up to our commitment to women & girls.”\nThis scandal has set off a feeding frenzy as Internet sleuths search for other incidents in which Franken has acted inappropriately.\nAnd of course, since we are talking about Al Franken, it wasn’t exactly difficult to find material.\nFor example, a photo has surfaced of Franken grabbing Joy Behar in a very creepy manner.\nThe following comes from Breitbart…\nAmid the emergence of a 2006 photo of Al Franken groping journalist and talk radio anchor Leeann Tweeden, a photo of the embattled Minnesota Senator appearing to grab comedian Joy Behar’s breast has also resurfaced.\nFranken was a comedian before he ever entered the world of politics, and we understand that.\nBut just because he was a comedian does not mean that he gets to play by a different set of rules.\nThere appears to be an ongoing pattern of behavior, and Fox News has documented some of the other incidents that have come up in the past…\nFranken, then a comedian, was quoted in a 1995 New York Magazine article discussing a skit for “Saturday Night Live” that involved drugging and raping CBS reporter Lesley Stahl.\nFranken, at the time a writer for “SNL,” suggested one skit should play out with “60 Minutes” commentator Andy Rooney finding an empty pill bottle on his desk.\n“’I give the pills to Lesley Stahl.\nThen when Lesley is passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her.’ Or ‘That’s why you never see Lesley until February.’ Or, ‘When she passes out.\nI put her in various positions and take pictures of her,’” Franken was quoted saying.\nThe article, along with a 2000 Playboy column in which Franken talked about fantasizing a machine would perform oral sex on him, was used to attack Franken during his 2008 Senate campaign in Minnesota.\nAs much as we may be appalled by some of the things that Al Franken has done, the truth is that there are far worse offenders in Washington.\nLet’s talk about Bill Clinton for a moment.\nDemocrats have been covering up his sexual crimes for years, and my hope is that now this will start to change.\nJuanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Connie Hamzy, Eileen Wellstone, Sandra Allen James, Christy Zercher, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, Gennifer Flowers, Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Susie Whitacre and Bobbie Ann William are some of the women that have made allegations against Clinton, and if even half of their allegations are true Clinton should be in prison for the rest of his life.\nIn my article yesterday, I discussed how one Secret Service agent is charging former Vice-President Joe Biden of engaging in “Weinstein-level” behavior, and I also talked about how 15 million dollars in settlements have been secretly paid out to victims of sexual harassment in the House of Representatives in recent years.\nThere is a culture of corruption in Washington D.C., and we desperately need to drain the swamp.\nIf you agree, I hope that you will support my campaign and the campaigns of other anti-establishment candidates that want to clean up the halls of Congress.\nIt is time to take our government back because at this point it has become an absolutely disgusting cesspool of filth and corruption.\nArticle posted with permission from End of the American Dream\n>","completion":"

Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, has championed Brett Kavanaugh’s #MeToo accuser, but Juanita Broaddrick says the senator never showed any interest in her 1999 rape allegation against President Bill Clinton.\nMs. Feinstein was elected in 1992, making her one of the few remaining senators who served during independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s investigation into Mr. Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\n“It’s absurd,” Ms. Broaddrick said Wednesday on Fox News.\n“Not one Democrat would look at my deposition with the independent counsel.\nOh my gosh, they did not want to know about it.” She pointed to the discrepancy between Democratic lack of interest in her case and the party’s outrage over allegations of sexual assault leveled last week against Mr. Kavanaugh.\n“Oh, it makes me go back to 1999, when Dianne Feinstein, along with every other Democrat, refused to read my deposition to the independent counsel,” said Ms. Broaddrick told Fox’s Laura Ingraham on Monday.\n“They would have nothing to do with it.\nThat shows you the difference in the double standard that existed back then and still does today.” Ms. Broaddrick has also lashed out at Sen. Dick Durbin, Illinois Democrat, who voted not guilty on the Clinton impeachment, as did Ms. Feinstein and Sen. Patty Murray, Washington Democrat.\n“You voted NOT GUILTY on both counts at Bill Clinton’s impeachment,” she tweeted.\n“You didn’t give a damn back then.\nYou, Dicky Durban [sic], are a complete FRAUD.” Ms. Broaddrick also said that if Senate Democrats want the FBI to investigate the 36-year-old accusations against Mr. Kavanaugh, they should reopen her 40-year-old case, too.\nIf you want the FBI to go back that far @[email protected] to investigate Ford’s allegations….\nlet’s investigate my RAPE allegations against Bill Clinton, too.\nSeems only fair.\nShe has long accused Mr. Clinton of raping her a motel room in 1978 in Little Rock, when he was Arkansas attorney general.\n“Go back that far, let’s investigate my situation,” she said on Wednesday.\n“Why not?\nEverybody says well it was litigated and adjudicated—my case was never litigated, it was never adjudicated.\nIt never went to court.\nI was never discredited at all.” Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, has accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school in Maryland.\nThe allegation went public last week after Ms. Feinstein, ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she received a letter about the incident in late July and referred the matter to federal authorities a week ago.\n“During every step of this process, I’ve found every single piece of information from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford eminently credible, sincere and believable,” tweeted Ms. Feinstein on Tuesday.\n“She knew this would have a huge effect on her life and she was incredibly brave to come forward.”\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|2814|2846\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|3071|3229\nName_Calling,Labeling|400|419\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1317|1349\nLoaded_Language|1836|1847\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|218|398\nLoaded_Language|1969|1979\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|2018|2195\nLoaded_Language|2566|2576\nDoubt|2848|2893\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|2926|3069\nRepetition|3594|3599\nExaggeration,Minimisation|4064|4108\nLoaded_Language|1317|1337\nLoaded_Language|2879|2893."}

Glenn Greenwald Best Price: $1.49 Buy New $3.70 (as of 06:30 EDT - Details)\nDennis Bernstein: We continue our discussion of the case of Julian Assange, now in the Ecuadorian embassy in Great Britain.\nJohn Pilger, it is great to talk to you again.\nBut it is a profound tragedy, John, the way they are treating Julian Assange, this prolific journalist and publisher who so many other journalists have depended on in the past.\nHe has been totally left out in the cold to fend for himself.\nJohn Pilger: I have never known anything like it.\nThere is a kind of eerie silence around the Julian Assange case.\nJulian has been vindicated in every possible way and yet he is isolated as few people are these days.\nHe is cut off from the very tools of his trade, visitors aren’t allowed.\nI was in London recently and I couldn’t see him, although I spoke to people who had seen him.\nRafael Correa, the former president of Ecuador, said recently that he regarded what they are doing to Julian now as torture.\nIt was Correa’s government that gave Julian political refuge, which has been betrayed now by his successor, the government led by Lenin Moreno, which is back to sucking up to the United States in the time-honored way, with Julian as the pawn and victim.\nShould be a ‘Constitutional Hero’\nBut really it comes down to the British government.\nAlthough he is still in a foreign embassy and actually has Ecuadorian nationality, his right of passage out of that embassy should be guaranteed by the British government.\nThe United Nations Working Party on Unlawful Detentions has made that clear.\nBritain took part in an investigation which determined that Julian was a political refugee and that a great miscarriage of justice had been imposed on him.\nIt is very good that you are doing this, Dennis, because even in the media outside the mainstream, there is this silence about Julian.\nThe streets outside the embassy are virtually empty, whereas they should be full of people saying that we are with you.\nThe principles involved in this case are absolutely clear-cut.\nNumber one is justice.\nThe injustice done to this man is legion, both in terms of the bogus Swedish case and now the fact that he must remain in the embassy and can’t leave without being arrested, extradited to the United States and ending up in a hell hole.\nBut it is also about freedom of speech, about our right to know, which is enshrined in the United States Constitution.\nIf the Constitution were taken literally, Julian would be a constitutional hero, actually.\nInstead, I understand the indictment they are trying to concoct reads like a charge of espionage!\nIt’s so ridiculous.That is the situation as I see it, Dennis.\nIt is not a happy one but it is one that people should rally to quickly.\nDB: His journalistic brethren are sounding like his prosecutors.\nThey want to get behind Russia-gate freaks like Congressman Adam Schiff and Mike Pompeo, who would like to see Assange in jail forever or even executed.\nHow do you respond to journalists acting like prosecutors, some of whom used his material to do stories?\nThis is a terrible time for journalism.\nJP: You are absolutely right: It is a terrible time for journalism.\nI have never known anything quite like it in my career.\nThat said, it is not new.\nThere has always been a so-called mainstream which really comes down to great power in media.\nIt has always existed, particularly in the United States.\nThe Pulitzer Prize this year was awarded to The New York Times and The Washington Post for witch-hunting around Russia-gate!\nThey were praised for “how deeply sourced their investigations were.” Their investigations turned up not a shred of real evidence to suggest any serious Russian intervention in the 2016 election.\nLike Webb\nThe Julian Assange case reminds me of the Gary Webb case.\nBob Parry was one of Gary Webb’s few supporters in the media.\nWebb’s “Dark Alliance” series contained evidence that cocaine trafficking was going on with the connivance of the CIA.\nLater Webb was hounded by fellow journalists and, unable to find work, he eventually committed suicide.\nThe CIA Inspector General subsequently vindicated him.\nNow, Julian Assange is a long way from taking his own life.\nHis resilience is remarkable.\nBut he is still a human being and he has taken such a battering.\nProbably the hardest thing for him to take is the utter hypocrisy of news organizations—like The New York Times, which published the WikiLeaks “War Logs” and “Cablegate,” The Washington Post and The Guardian, which has taken a vindictive delight in tormenting Julian.\nThe Guardian a few years ago got a Pulitzer Prize writing about Snowden.\nBut their coverage of Snowden left him in Hong Kong.\nIt was WikiLeaks that got Snowden out of Hong Kong and to safety.\nProfessionally, I find this one of the most unsavory and immoral things I have seen in my career.\nThe persecution of this man by huge media organizations which have drawn great benefit from WikiLeaks.\nOne of Assange’s great tormentors, The Guardian‘s Luke Harding, made a great deal of money with a Hollywood version of a book that he and David Lee wrote in which they basically attacked their source.\nI suppose you have to be a psychiatrist to understand all of this.\nMy understanding is that so many of these journalists are shamed.\nThey realize that WikiLeaks has done what they should have done a long time ago, and that is to tell us how governments lie.\nDB: One thing that disturbs me greatly is the way in which the Western corporate press speculate about Russian involvement in the U.S. 2016 election, that it was a hack through Julian Assange.\nAny serious investigator would want to know who would be motivated.\nAnd yet the possibility that it might be the dozen or so pissed-off people who went to work for the Clinton machine and learned from the inside that the DNC was all about getting rid of Bernie Sanders…this is not a part of the story!\nEight Hundred Thousand Disclosures on Russia\nJP: What happened to Sanders and the way that he was rolled by the Clinton organization, everybody knows that this is the story.\nAnd now we have the DNC suing WikiLeaks!\nThere’s a kind of farcical element to this.\nI mean, none of this came from the Russians.\nThat WikiLeaks is somehow in bed with the Russians is ludicrous.\nWikiLeaks published about 800,000 major disclosures about Russia, some of them extremely critical of the Russian government.\nIf you are a government and you are doing something untoward or you are lying to your people and WikiLeaks gets the documents to show it, they will publish no matter who you are, be they the United States or Russia.\nDB: Randy Credico, because of his work and his decision to devote a very high-profile series to the persecution of Julian Assange, recently found himself under attack.\nHe went to the White House Press Roast and, after having a nice discussion with Congressman Schiff, he yelled out “What about Julian Assange?” The room was packed full of reporters but Randy was attacked and dragged out.\nIt was if everyone there was embarrassed to recognize that one of their brethren was being brutalized.\nJP: Randy shouted some truth.\nIt is very similar to what happened to Ray McGovern.\nRay is a former member of the CIA but extremely principled.\nI might suggest he is a renegade now.\nDB: It was hysterical to watch these four armed guards who kept shouting “Stop resisting, stop resisting!” and they are beating the hell out of him!\nJP: I thought the image of Ray being hauled off was particularly telling.\nThese four overweight, obviously ill-trained young men manhandling Ray, who is 78 years old.\nThere was something highly emblematic about that for me.\nHe stood up to challenge the fact that the CIA was about to hand over leadership to a person who had been in charge of torture.\nIt is both shocking and surreal, which of course the Julian Assange case is as well.\nBut real journalism should be able to get through the shocking and the surreal and get to the truth.\nThere is so much collusion now, with all these dark and menacing developments.\nIt is almost as if the word “journalism” is becoming blighted.\nDB: There has certainly been a lot of collusion when it comes to Israel.\nThen the word “collusion” is quite appropriate.\nJP:That’s the ultimate collusion.\nBut that’s collusion with silence.\nNever has there been a collusion like the one between the U.S. and Israel.\nIt suggests another word and that is “immunity.” It has a moral immunity, a cultural immunity, a geopolitical immunity, a legal immunity, and certainly a media immunity.\nWe see the gunning down of over 60 people on the day of the inauguration of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem.\nIsrael has some of the most wickedly experimental munitions in the world and they fired them at people who were protesting the occupation of their homeland and trying to remind people of the Nakba and the right of return.\nIn the media these were described as “clashes.” Although they did become so bad that The New York Times in a later edition changed its front page headline to say that Israel was actually killing people.\nA rare moment, indeed, when the immunity, the collusion was interrupted.\nAll the talk of Iran and nuclear weapons is without any reference to the biggest nuclear power in the Middle East.\nDB: What would you say have been the contributions that Julian Assange has made in this age of censorship and cowardice in journalism?\nWhere does he come into the picture?\nJP:I think it comes down to information.\nIf you go back to when WikiLeaks started, when Julian was sitting in his hotel room in Paris beginning to put the whole thing together, one of the first things he wrote was that there is a morality in transparency, that we have a right to know what those who wish to control our lives are doing in secret.\nThe right to know what governments are doing in our name—on our behalf or to our detriment—is our moral right.\nJulian feels very passionately about this.\nThere were times when he could have compromised slightly in order to possibly help his situation.\nThere were times when I said to him, “Why don’t you just suspend that for a while and go along with it?” Of course, I knew beforehand what his answer would be and that was “no.” The enormous amount of information that has come from WikiLeaks, particularly in recent years, has amounted to an extraordinary public service.\nI was reading just the other day a 2006 WikiLeaks cable from the U.S. embassy in Caracas which was addressed to other agencies in the region.\nThis was four years after the U.S. tried to get rid of Chavez in a coup.\nIt detailed how subversion should work.\nOf course, they dressed it up as human rights work and so on.\nI was reading this official document thinking how the information contained in it was worth years of the kind of distorted reporting from Venezuela.\nIt also reminds us that so-called “meddling” by Russia in the U.S. is just nonsense.\nThe word “meddling” doesn’t apply to the kind of action implied in this document.\nIt is intervention in another country’s affairs.\nWikiLeaks has done that all over the world.\nIt has given people the information they have a right to have.\nThey had a right to find out from the so-called “War Logs” the criminality of our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nThey had a right to find out about Cablegate.\nThat’s when, on Clinton’s watch, we learned that the NSA was gathering personal information on members of the United Nations Security Council, including their credit card numbers.\nYou can see why Julian made enemies.\nBut he should also have made a huge number of friends.\nThis is critical information because it tells us how power works and we will never learn about it otherwise.\nI think WikiLeaks has opened a world of transparency and put flesh on the expression “right to know.” This must explain why he is attacked so much, because that is so threatening.\nThe enemy to great power is not the likes of the Taliban, it is us.\nDB: And who can forget the release of the “collateral murder” footage by Chelsea Manning?\nJP: That kind of thing is not uncommon.\nVietnam was meant to be the open war but really it wasn’t.\nThere weren’t the cameras around.\nIt is indeed shocking information but it informs people, and we have Chelsea Manning’s courage to thank for that.\nDB: Yes, and the thanks he got was seven years in solitary confinement.\nThey want to prosecute Assange and maybe hang him from the rafters in Congress, but what about Judith Miller and The New York Times lying the West into war?\nThere is no end of horrific examples of what passes for journalism, in contrast to the amazing contribution that Julian Assange has made.\nClick here to listen to this

{"prompt":"Avenatti’s Freak Show\n\nOn the eve of a historic Supreme Court confirmation hearing, two more women have materialized out of thin air to accuse President Trump’s high court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual improprieties – bringing the total number of accusers to four.\nEven more eleventh-hour character-assassination attempts may be coming given the enraged Left’s determination to prevent the judge’s ascent to the Supreme Court at all costs.\nWhether the claims are true is irrelevant to these people.\nOnly the seriousness and luridness of the charges matter as they get aired over and over again in the 24-hour news cycle.\nThey don’t care about the victims they create.\nOnly the headlines.\nThe new allegations surfaced yesterday as the Senate Judiciary Committee battens down the hatches for a hearing today to receive oral evidence from the first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student.\nThe third accuser is Julie Swetnick, a 55-year-old certified systems engineer, who on Wednesday claimed that in the early 1980s Kavanaugh and others spiked the drinks of young women at high school parties with intoxicants to clear the way for them to be gang-raped.\nIncredibly, Swetnick said in a sworn statement that she witnessed gang rapes at these parties but kept on attending them anyway.\nIt gets weirder.\nKavanaugh was a “mean drunk,” she stated.\nHe drank excessively at these parties and would grind against girls and try to take their clothing of, she said.\nSwetnick claimed to have been gang-raped at one of these parties in 1982 as a result of consuming a spiked drink that contained “Quaaludes or something similar.” Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge were present at the party at which she was raped, she states, but she doesn’t accuse them of participating in it.\nIn response, Kavanaugh labeled Swetnick's salacious allegations \"ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone.\"\n\"I don't know who this is and this never happened,\" the judicial nominee added.\nA CNBC summary describes Swetnick:\nA 1980 graduate of Gaithersburg High School in Maryland, she said she has held multiple clearances for work done at the Treasury Department, U.S. Mint, IRS, State Department and Justice Department, among other government agencies.\nSwetnick says in her affidavit that she saw Kavanaugh in the early 1980s \"drink excessively at many\" house parties in suburban Maryland.\nAt the time, Kavanaugh and Judge were students at Georgetown Prep, a private Catholic all-boys school.\nShe said Kavanaugh and Judge engaged in \"abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls,\" which \"included the fondling and groping of girls without their consent\" and \"not taking 'No' for an answer.\"\nPredictably, all 10 Democrat members of the Judiciary Committee urged President Trump to either \"immediately withdraw the nomination or order an FBI investigation into all the allegations.\"\nThere is no indication so far that the president will oblige them.\nTo no one’s surprise, Trump’s legal tormentor, Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti, whom Tucker Carlson has dubbed “creepy porn lawyer,” is representing Swetnick.\n\"There should be an immediate investigation\" of Swetnick’s dramatic allegations, Avenatti said on MSNBC, \"and there should be no rush to confirm him to the U.S. Supreme Court.\"\nThe president slammed Avenatti.\n“Avenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh[,]” Trump wrote on Twitter.\n“He is just looking for attention and doesn’t want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life!”\nHe rejected Swetnick’s allegations as “another beauty” and described Avenatti as a “con artist.”\n“All of a sudden, the hearings are over, and the rumors start coming out,” Trump said.\n“And then you this other con artist, Avenatti, come out with another beauty today.\"\nA fourth accuser popped up yesterday, Politico reports.\nAccording to an interview transcript released Wednesday night by the Senate Judiciary Committee:\nAn anonymous woman wrote to Sen. Cory Gardner’s (R-Colo.) office on Sept. 22 alleging that the Supreme Court nominee shoved another woman “up against the wall very aggressively and sexually” in 1998 after leaving a bar where both had been drinking, the transcript states.\nKavanaugh denied any involvement in the events alleged in that complaint, which was first reported by NBC.\nDepending on how you do the counting, there may even be a fifth and sixth accusation against Kavanaugh.\nThe newspaper account continues:\nThe transcript of Kavanaugh's Tuesday interview also cited another anonymous claim of sexual misconduct involving Kavanaugh, dating back to 1985 and sent to the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), which the judge also flatly denied to investigators.\nAnd GOP investigators said late Wednesday they received an additional anonymous claim of rape passed along by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).\nAccuser number two is Deborah Ramirez, 53, who went public with her claims in a New Yorker magazine article Sunday.\nRamirez alleges she was assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College.\nShe claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.\nIf Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.\nIt normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have been only eight justices.\nRoughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.\nDemocrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they may seize control from Republicans.\nElection Day is November 6.\nThe GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.\nThe proceedings Thursday are supposed to get underway at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.\nCommittee Republicans considered the political optics and didn’t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to ask the questions at what promises to be a highly-watched hearing.\nDemocrats predictably freaked out at the decision to have a woman lead the questioning since their primary objective here is to embarrass and discredit Kavanaugh and other Republicans, not get at the truth.\n“It is going against everything I’ve seen for 44 years,\" huffed committee member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.).\n\"They’re not following normal procedure.\"\nAs expected, at today’s hearing Kavanaugh will firmly rebut the increasingly outrageous claims being leveled at him.\nAccording to prepared testimony provided to The Hill newspaper, he will say:\nI categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford.\nI never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford.\nI am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time.\nBut I have never done that to her or to anyone.\nKavanaugh added: \"I am innocent of this charge.\"\nNot surprisingly Ford’s prepared testimony also found its way to reporters.\n“I am here today not because I want to be,” Ford says in her opening statement.\n“I am terrified.\nI am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.”\nShe describes the nominee as “Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me,” and claims “Brett’s assault on me drastically altered my life,” but at the same time acknowledges “Brett did not rape me.”\nGiven that Kavanaugh has already passed six incredibly intrusive FBI investigations, odds are Ford is lying or suffering from some kind of psychological disorder such as false memory syndrome.\nMany commentators have drawn parallels between Ford and Anita Hill, who in 1991 accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual improprieties.\nBoth women are college professors.\nBoth claim to have reluctantly been drawn into confirmation battles.\nFord claims to be a victim of attempted rape; Hill claims to have been a victim of sexual harassment in the workplace.\nOnly left-wingers and feminists like Maureen Dowd still believe Hill, now an utterly undistinguished politically correct scholar who discredited herself by –among other things— following her then-boss Thomas as his subordinate when he switched jobs.\nAn abused person wouldn’t do that.\nBut all the lies about Thomas at what he described as a “high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” had an effect.\nIn the end, the Senate barely approved his nomination 52 to 48 on October 15, 1991.\nWith all the mud Democrats have been slinging at Kavanaugh, he would be thrilled to be approved by a margin as wide as 52 to 48.\nConservatives need to remember that the purpose of the Left’s frenzied, demagogic assault is to damage the nominee, and by extension, the president who nominated him.\nIf they can derail Kavanaugh’s nomination, that is an added bonus.\nThe Left’s attacks on Kavanaugh in the #MeToo era are working, a USA Today article suggests:\nDisapproval for Kavanaugh … is at an unprecedented level for a Supreme Court nominee amid the allegations against him, according to a new USA TODAY\/Ipsos Public Affairs Poll.\nThose surveyed said by 40 percent to 31 percent that the Senate shouldn't vote to approve his nomination, the first time a plurality of Americans have opposed a Supreme Court nominee since polling on the issue began.\nThe case against confirming Kavanaugh may be somewhere between weak and non-existent, but the constant repetition of the unsupported allegations in the Trump-hating media is clearly taking its toll on the nominee.\nThat said, the Senate Judiciary Committee is tentatively scheduled to vote on the nomination Friday at 9:30 a.m.\n\"If we're ready to vote, we will vote,” Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tweeted Tuesday at 6:46 p.m. “If we aren't ready, we won't.”\nObviously, a lot is riding on the confirmation.\n“We're watching a period where what we have to understand is this is about raw power,\" former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Tuesday.\n\"And if the Left can stop Kavanaugh we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime on the Supreme Court.\"\nPresident Trump quoted the nation’s most prominent conservative radio host as he urged GOP senators to get onboard Tuesday:\n“Rush Limbaugh to Republicans: ‘You can kiss the MIDTERMS goodbye if you don’t get highly qualified Kavanaugh approved.’”\nTrump is right.\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|1403|1416\nLoaded_Language|1921|1958\nName_Calling,Labeling|3134|3152\nLoaded_Language|3372|3379\nName_Calling,Labeling|3403|3422\nName_Calling,Labeling|3665|3681\nName_Calling,Labeling|3768|3778\nName_Calling,Labeling|3882|3913\nLoaded_Language|6390|6401\nDoubt|7876|7973\nName_Calling,Labeling|9833|9851\nLoaded_Language|10617|10650\nLoaded_Language|7693|7720\nLoaded_Language|8846|8881\nName_Calling,Labeling|0|21\nLoaded_Language|99|132\nSlogans|293|316\nName_Calling,Labeling|346|364\nLoaded_Language|765|789\nRepetition|1574|1584\nName_Calling,Labeling|3035|3058\nDoubt|3391|3531\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|3561|3662\nName_Calling,Labeling|3723|3737\nName_Calling,Labeling|3929|3943\nName_Calling,Labeling|6168|6181\nLoaded_Language|6917|6953\nLoaded_Language|7430|7444\nName_Calling,Labeling|7606|7656\nName_Calling,Labeling|8359|8403\nName_Calling,Labeling|8431|8482\nName_Calling,Labeling|9013|9051\nCausal_Oversimplification|8998|9127\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|10617|10703\nName_Calling,Labeling|8696|8732."}
{"prompt":"Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon reported Wednesday that “the Obama administration skirted key U.S. sanctions to grant Iran access to billions in hard currency despite public assurances the administration was engaged in no such action, according to a new congressional investigation.”\nAnd it gets even worse: “The investigation, published Wednesday by the House Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, further discloses secret efforts by top Obama administration officials to assure European countries they would receive a pass from U.S. sanctions if they engaged in business with Iran.”\nThis revelation comes after the news that came to light in February, that, according to Bill Gertz in the Washington Times, “the U.S. government has traced some of the $1.7 billion released to Iran by the Obama administration to Iranian-backed terrorists in the two years since the cash was transferred.”\nThere is a law that applies to this situation.\nU.S. Code 2381 says: “Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.”\nIn a sane political environment, Barack Obama would be tried for treason.\nBarack Hussein Obama has planted seeds that will be bearing bitter fruit for years, and probably decades, to come.\nHe is, without any doubt, the worst President in American history.\nFillmore, Pierce, Buchanan?\nYes, the doughface Presidents made the Civil War inevitable, but worse came later.\nGrant?\nBlind to corruption and out of his depth, but there have been worse than he as well.\nWilson?\nThat black-hearted Presbyterian bigot arguably gave the world Hitler and World War II, so he is definitely in the Final Four.\nHarding?\nNah: his tax cuts and return to “normalcy” got the American economy, and the Twenties, roaring.\nFDR and LBJ gave us the modern welfare state and dependent classes automatically voting Democrat; the full bill on the damage they did hasn’t yet been presented.\nNixon?\nA crook and an economic Leftist, who betrayed Taiwan for the People’s Republic; his record certainly isn’t good.\nCarter?\nNothing good can be said about his four years of sanctimony and incompetence.\nBut there is one thing Barack Obama has on all competitors: treason.\nHe showered hundreds of billions of dollars on the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nThere are those who say, “It was their money.\nIt belonged to the Iranian government but was frozen and not paid since 1979.” Indeed, and there was a reason for that: not even Jimmy Carter, who made the Islamic Republic of Iran possible, thought that money, which had been paid by the Shah’s government in a canceled arms deal, belonged to the mullahs who overthrew the Shah.\nLikewise Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush all thought that the Islamic Republic was not due money that was owed to the Shah.\nOnly Barack Obama did.\nThe definition of treason is giving aid and comfort to the enemy.\nThe leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran order their people to chant “Death to America” in mosques every Friday, and repeatedly vow that they will ultimately destroy the United States of America and the state of Israel.\nHow was giving them billions and helping them skirt sanctions applied by the U.S. government not treason?\nOther Presidents have been incompetent, corrupt, dishonest, but which has committed treason on a scale to rival the treason of Barack Obama?\nThe Iranians also operate a global network of jihad terror organizations, one of which, Hizballah, is quite active in Mexico now, with the obvious ultimate intention of crossing the border and committing jihad massacres of Americans.\nObama has given a tremendous boost to these initiatives, as well as to Iran’s nuclear program, with his nuclear deal that has given the Iranians hundreds of billions of dollars and essentially a green light to manufacture nuclear weapons, in exchange for absolutely nothing.\nThere is no telling when the worst consequences of Obama’s aid and comfort to the Islamic Republic of Iran will be felt.\nBut they likely will be felt in one way or another.\nEven as President Trump moves swiftly to restore sanctions and put Iran on notice that its nuclear activity and global adventurism will not be tolerated, those billions cannot be recovered, and the Iranians have already spent a great deal for their jihad cause.\nHowever this catastrophe plays out, there is one man who will suffer no consequences whatsoever: Barack Obama.\nThat’s Leftist Privilege.\nIt’s good to be a powerful Leftist in Washington nowadays.\nLaws?\nPah!\nLaws are for conservatives.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|8|15\nExaggeration,Minimisation|17|27\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1604|1613\nName_Calling,Labeling|1861|1893\nName_Calling,Labeling|2258|2287\nRepetition|1184|1191\nRepetition|1454|1461\nRepetition|2515|2522\nRepetition|3164|3171\nRepetition|3532|3539\nRepetition|3625|3632\nRepetition|3657|3664\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1536|1567\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2377|2389\nSlogans|3284|3302\nLoaded_Language|3892|3901\nLoaded_Language|3934|3944\nExaggeration,Minimisation|336|346\nName_Calling,Labeling|1763|1782\nLoaded_Language|3568|3579\nLoaded_Language|3581|3588\nLoaded_Language|3590|3599\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|3875|3901\nFlag-Waving|3902|3914\nLoaded_Language|4639|4650."}

{"prompt":"Black Death Warning: The Plague Is Impossible To Eradicate\n\nFace masks are placed on children in Antananarivo, Madagascar (AP Photo\/Alexander JOE)\nAn expert is warning the plague that has sickened over 2000 people in Madagascar since August is impossible to eradicate.\nEven though the number of those infected has dropped in recent weeks, the plague will never truly be gone.\nSince the airborne version of the plague can kill a person in just three hours, experts warn that its too soon to think that since there hasn’t been a person infected in recent days, that it won’t pop up again.\nThat’s because the bacteria that causes plague is now so widespread in wildlife, that humans can’t do anything to get rid of it, said Dr. Allen Cheng, Professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at Monash University in Melbourne.\n“It’s not possible to eradicate plague, as it is widespread in wildlife rodents outside the sphere of human influence,” Cheng wrote on The Conversation.\n“Outbreaks, generally, are managed reactively by ‘firefighting teams’, deployed to clear houses of fleas, identify and treat cases and give pre-emptive treatment to contacts at risk.\nA more preventative approach, such as the identification of areas at risk using climate models and animal surveys to focus flea and rat control efforts, would be better,” he said.\n“But, this requires a better understanding of transmission pathways in each region where disease persists.”\nThe best way to stop the plague spreading was to focus on flea and rat control in the most at-risk areas, he said.\nCheng’s comments came after at least 171 people died in Madagascar over an outbreak of plague.\nNine countries were urged by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to prepare for a black death attack, at the end of October.\nIt’s been reported that plague has been transmitted to humans by camels, goats, prairie dogs, rock squirrels and guinea pigs since the 1960’s.\nThere are only a few remaining hotspots for plague in the world – Madagascar being one of them.\nThis outbreak was also highly “unusual”, in that several different parts of the island were affected, including areas with lots of people.\nWHO has reported 2119 cases of the plague as of November 10.\n171 have died of the disease so far.\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|0|11\nRepetition|339|374\nAppeal_to_Authority|602|714\nRepetition|820|857\nName_Calling,Labeling|1735|1746\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|21|58\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|160|267\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1721|1753."}
{"prompt":"No Justice for Kate Steinle\n\nA San Francisco jury on Thursday found Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, also known as Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, not guilty of the murder of Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier on July 1, 2015.\nThe jury of six men and six women, including three immigrants, found the Mexican national not guilty of all murder and manslaughter charges and guilty only of felony possession of a firearm.\nFor Garcia’s Zarate’s attorney, Matt Gonzalez, Ralph Nader’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election, the trial was all about Donald Trump.\n“For those who might criticize this verdict – there are a number of people who have commented on this case in the last couple of years,” Gonzalez said after the verdict, “the Attorney General of the United States and the President and Vice President of the United States.\nLet me just remind them, they are themselves under investigation by a special prosecutor in Washington D.C. and they may soon avail themselves of the presumption of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt, so I ask that they reflect on that before they comment or disparage the results of this case.”\n“From day one this case was used as a means to foment hate, to foment division and to foment a program of mass deportation,” added defense attorney Francisco Ugarte.\n“It was used to catapult a presidency along that philosophy of hate of others.\nI believe today is a day of vindication for the rights of immigrants.”\nAlex Bastian of the San Francisco prosecutor’s office told reporters the verdict “was not the one we were hoping for,” but the Steinle family could be forgiven for any reasonable doubts about the prosecution.\n“We’re just shocked — saddened and shocked ... that’s about it,” Jim Steinle, Kate’s father, told the San Francisco Chronicle.\n“There’s no other way you can coin it.\nJustice was rendered, but it was not served.” Kate’s brother Brad was “stunned that they couldn’t even get him on using the weapon.”\nAttorney David Wohl told Fox News that with negligent discharge of a firearm, the defendant’s action met every standard for involuntary manslaughter.\nThe verdict, Wohl said, was “an utter and complete and total failure by the prosecutor.”\nConservative Ben Shapiro told Fox news the verdict was “horrifying.\n.\n.\nPolitics trumps evidence in California once again.” For Jeff Sessions San Francisco’s sanctuary city policy “led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.” According to the Attorney General’s statement, the Justice Department “will continue to ensure that all jurisdictions place the safety and security of their communities above the convenience of criminal aliens.”\nFor his part, President Trump tweeted: “A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case!\nNo wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.”\nMexican national Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 54, is a seven-time felon and has been deported five times.\nIn 2015 federal authorities sought to detain him for deportation.\nSan Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi chose to defy the feds and release the Mexican national.\nOn July 1, 2015, the criminal illegal picked up a Sig Sauer .40 caliber pistol, stolen from a Bureau of Land Management officer, and fired the shot that killed Kate Steinle, only 32 years old.\nThe Mexican nation and career criminal enjoyed all the rights of the American legal system, the presumption of innocence, and a high-profile defense attorney funded by American taxpayers.\nDuring the trial, former vice presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez claimed that Garcia Zarate’s background and nationality played a role in his prosecution.\nAs Gonzalez argued, “If this was a college student or Swedish kid would he be charged with murder?”\nThat sort of politically correct nonsense plays well in San Francisco, so any observer of the case could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted, regardless of the tragedy for the Steinle family.\nThe felony firearms charge, the only charge on which Garcia Zarate was found guilty, carries a sentence of 16 months to 3 years.\nSince Garcia Zarate has been languishing in jail, the authorities could commute any sentence to time served and he could walk free within weeks.\nSan Francisco is not likely to hand the felon over to ICE for deportation.\nShould that happen, Garcia Zarate has already proved five times that anybody can get away with violating U.S. immigration law.\nHe has already proved that in the sanctuary state of California, false-documented illegals are a privileged class.\nJose Ines Garcia Zarate, or whatever his real name is, has also proved that a career criminal who is not even supposed to be in the country can literally get away with murder in broad daylight.\nWhen that happens, the killer’s public defender will call it a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”\nIn San Francisco, and across California, this verdict will surely give new meaning to the cry of “no justice, no peace.”\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"The US Is Blatantly Telling Lies\n\nIt’s no secret that the Trump administration has a strong distaste for Iran.\nIran is one of the only issues on which the U.S. president has remained relatively consistent.\nTrump berated the country both before and after taking office.\nHowever, Trump’s anti-Iran strategy goes against the better judgment of even the most anti-Iranian advisors in his staff who don’t want to see the U.S. isolated on the world stage.\nFortunately for Trump, however, he is not alone in his bid to isolate and demonize Iran at all costs.\nOn December 12, Trump’s ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, gave a grandiose speech demonizing Iran that echoed Colin Powell’s infamous performance before the U.N. in 2003.\nHaley’s essential claim was that Saudi Arabia is under attack by missiles supplied to Yemen by the Iranian government and that the world should not sit idly by as this goes on.\n“If we do nothing about the missiles fired at Saudi Arabia, we will not be able to stop the violence,” Haley warned.\n“There is clear evidence that the missiles that landed on Saudi Arabia come from Iran,” she said.\n“The evidence is undeniable.\nThe weapons might as well have had ‘Made in Iran’ stickers all over it.”\nBuy Gold at Discounted Prices\nHowever, even as Haley opened her mouth, many commentators could already identify a number of issues with her speech.\nAs Common Dream’s Reza Marashi explained:\n“Haley cited a UN report in her claim regarding Iranian missile transfers to the Houthis.\nOf course, the UN has reached no such conclusion.\nInstead, a panel of experts concluded that fired missile fragments show components from an Iranian company, but they have ‘no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier.’ Asked about Haley’s claim that Iran is the culprit, Sweden’s ambassador to the UN said, ‘The info I have is less clear.’ Analysts from the U.S. Department of Defense speaking to reporters at Haley’s speech openly acknowledged that they do not know the missiles’ origin.\nPerhaps most surreal is the very same UN report cited by Haley also says the missile included a component that was manufactured by an American company.\nDid she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remarks, or fail to read the entire UN report?\nThe world may never know.”\nRegardless of the fact that Haley misrepresented the U.N. report in question, it appears the entire premise of the U.N. report is almost completely incorrect, anyway, according to former inspector Scott Ritter.\nRitter writes:\n“The missile debris in question actually contradicts the finding of the UN panel, which held that the missiles launched against Saudi Arabia had been transferred to Yemen in pieces and assembled there by Houthi missile engineers; it is clear that the missiles in question had been in the possession of Yemen well before the Saudi Arabian-led intervention of 2015, and that their source was either Soviet or North Korean.\nThe modification kits, on the other hand, appear to be of Iranian origin, and were transported to Yemen via Oman.\nThe UN panel claims not to have any evidence of ‘external missile specialists’ working alongside the Houthi; indeed, the simplicity of the Burkhan 2-H modification concept is such that anyone already familiar with the SCUD-B missile system would be able to implement the required processes without outside assistance.” [emphasis added]\nSo where did the missiles come from, and who made them?\nAccording to Ritter:\n“Rather than the Iranian-manufactured Qiam-1 missiles Haley and the Saudi Arabian government claimed, the debris presented by Haley were of a modified Soviet-manufactured SCUD-B missile; the airframe and engine are original Soviet-made components, and many of the smaller parts on display bear Cyrillic (i.e., Russian) markings.\nThe transformation to the Burkhan 2-H design required the Houthi engineers to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and lengthen the airframe accordingly.\nThis is done by cutting the airframe, and welding in place the appropriate segments (this also required that the fuel supply pipe, which passes through the oxidizer tank, be similarly lengthened.)\nThe difference in quality between the factory welds and the new welds is readily discernable.\nThe increased fuel supply permits a longer engine burn, which in turn increases the range of the missile.\nThe Burkhan 2-H uses a smaller warhead than the SCUD B; as such, the guidance and control section had been reconfigured to a smaller diameter, and an inter-stage section added to connect the warhead\/guidance section with the main airframe.”\n﻿\nThose who have been paying attention to this conflict have been well aware that the U.S. has had little material evidence to link Yemen’s Houthis to Iranian arms suppliers.\nIn January of this year, a panel of U.N. experts stated:\n“The panel has not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct large-scale supply of arms from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, although there are indicators that anti-tank guided weapons being supplied to the Houthi or Saleh forces are of Iranian manufacture.” [emphasis added]\nEven if Iran were arming the Houthis, Haley’s hypocritical anti-Iran rhetoric doesn’t excuse the U.S. for continuing a foreign policy that essentially armed ISIS through U.S. weapons transfers, or for arming al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, just to name two examples of Washington’s schizophrenic approach to the region.\nWhy is the U.S. singling out Iran, especially when the Houthi rebels are sworn enemies of al-Qaeda?\nThe issues here go much deeper than nonsensical hypocrisy.\nAccording to Ritter, the entire debacle has shown that if Saudi Arabia cannot contain the Houthi’s missile capabilities, it cannot possibly hope to take on Iran, which possesses a significantly more advanced military than the Houthis do on their own.\nRitter explains further:\n“If a relatively unsophisticated foe such as the Houthi, using Iranian-modified Soviet and North Korean missiles derived from 40-year-old technology, can evade an enemy force using the most modern combat aircraft backed up by the most sophisticated intelligence gathering systems available, and successfully launch ballistic missiles that threaten the political and economic infrastructure of the targeted state, what does that say about the prospects of any U.S.-led coalition taking on the far more advanced mobile missile threats that exist in North Korea and Iran today?\nThe fact of the matter is that no military anywhere has shown the ability to successfully interdict in any meaningful way a determined opponent armed with mobile ballistic missile capability.\nIf the Saudi experience in Yemen is to teach us anything, it is that any military plan designed to confront nations such as North Korea, Iran and Russia that are armed with sophisticated mobile ballistic missiles had better count on those capabilities remaining intact throughout any anticipated period of hostility.\nNo amount of chest-thumping and empty rhetoric by American political and\/or military leaders can offset this harsh reality.\nThis is the critical lesson of Yemen, and the United States would do well to heed it before it tries to foment a crisis based upon trumped-up charges.” [emphasis added]\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_fear-prejudice|904|1003\nDoubt|2154|2259\nLoaded_Language|5170|5182\nDoubt|0|32\nDoubt|2380|2444\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|7086|7235\nLoaded_Language|1183|1219\nDoubt|5443|5542\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|305|337\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|355|448\nLoaded_Language|5405|5427\nLoaded_Language|6962|7084."}

New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N.\nAmbassador John Bolton.\nFor over a decade, Bolton has been calling for regime change in Iran.\nNow, he’s the National Security Advisor.\nIt just so happens that at least one of these calls for regime change in Iran was caught on video last year as Bolton gave a speech at the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran.\n“There is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today.\nI had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs’ regime in Tehran.\nThe behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself.\nAnd that’s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!”\nPay attention to the first line in that quote above in which Bolton notes that the opposition needed to overthrow Iran’s current regime “is centered in this room today.” Who was in that room?\nWell, the entire event was actually put on by the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, also known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK.\nAs Politico pointed out in a 2016 article, despite the neocon attempts to rewrite history, MEK have killed Americans and committed multiple acts of terrorism.\nFor decades, and based on U.S. intelligence, the United States government has blamed the MEK for killing three U.S. Army colonels and three U.S. contractors, bombing the facilities of numerous U.S. companies and killing innocent Iranians.\nTo recap, the formerly terrorist-classified organization MEK, trained in the US and granted special privilege status by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2012—which has since been heavily funded to refine their image by having famous US neoconservative war hawks from both sides of the isle actually chant for “regime change” on their behalf—is now the darling child of the neocon agenda and the impetus behind what could kick of World War 3.\nWhile the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom, the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran or American citizens is outright insane.\nTo see what US intervention—through military support and the support of opposition groups—does to countries, one need only look at Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya to see the horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias left in America’s wake.\nTo those paying attention over the years, Trump’s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media and from all sides of the political spectrum should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report.\nThis was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense.\n“This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years,” Clark said.\n“Starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.”\nAll presidents since Clinton have crossed countries off this list.\nNow it’s Trump’s turn.\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|3964|3977\nLoaded_Language|4439|4447\nLoaded_Language|4244|4259\nLoaded_Language|4464|4485\nLoaded_Language|730|745\nSlogans|2380|2389\nDoubt|3047|3068."}

{"prompt":"Israel Takes On the Shia Crescent\n\nDespite Israel's repeated warnings, Barack Obama's reckless appeasement of the Iranian regime has enabled its rise as a hegemonic threat in the Middle East region as well as a threat to international peace and security.\nIn 2009, Obama turned his back on millions of dissidents in the streets of Tehran and other Iranian cities, who were peacefully protesting the rigged election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president.\nIn 2011, Obama precipitously removed the remaining U.S. combat troops from Iraq, giving rise to ISIS’s re-emergence in Iraq from its bases in Syria.\nThe radical Shiite Iranian regime purported to come to the “rescue” of both countries from the Sunni terrorists, turning Iraq into a virtual vassal state of the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the process.\nObama's disastrous nuclear deal with Iran legitimized Iran's path to eventually becoming a nuclear-armed state, while immediately filling its coffers with billions of dollars to fund its aggression.\nMeanwhile, Syria has become ground zero for Iran's execution of its regional ambitions, which is to establish its Shiite Crescent connecting with its allies, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.\nThis plan has included the establishment of a land route that Iranian-backed militias secured in June, beginning on Iran’s border with Iraq and running across Iraq and Syria all the way to Syria’s Mediterranean coast.\nThis road makes Iran’s job easier in supplying arms by land, as well as by air and sea, to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and to equip Iran’s own forces fighting inside of Syria in support of Assad.\nThis helps explain why Iran has placed so much importance on helping the Syrian regime establish control over the Deir ez-Zor area in eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border.\n“Everything depends now on the Americans’ willingness to stop this,” said an Iraqi Kurdish official who was quoted in a New Yorker article.\nHowever, U.S.-led coalition forces apparently have done next to nothing to stop this major advance in Iran’s Shiite Crescent expansion.\n“Obama ran down our options in Syria so thoroughly, by the time this administration took over,” said Andrew Tabler, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n“The Iranian influence is spreading because they are so heavily involved in regime activities,” Tabler added.\n“It’s a new monster.”\nFurthermore, Iran has funded and armed its terrorist proxy Hezbollah, which has sent its militia from its home base of Lebanon to fight alongside Assad's forces.\nAnd Iran has used Syria as a transit point for shipment of sophisticated rockets to Hezbollah in Lebanon for future use against Israeli population centers.\nDespite the fact that Hezbollah has American blood on its hands, the U.S.-led coalition has chosen not to do anything about Hezbollah’s presence in Syria, bought and paid for by Iran.\nWhile Israel chose not to take sides in Syria's civil war with military intervention of its own, it has bombed weapons storage facilities and convoys inside Syria for its own protection.\nJust recently, on September 7th, Israeli jets struck a Syrian weapons facility near Masyaf, which was reported to have been used for the production of chemical weapons and the storage of missiles.\nIsrael will also do what is necessary to repel Iranian-backed forces if they edge too close to areas near the Golan Heights, shrinking the buffer between Israel and Iranian controlled territories.\nHowever, such tactical measures may not be enough to thwart Iran’s larger ambitions.\nIn light of intelligence reports that Assad may be ready to invite Iran to set up military bases in Syria, Israeli leaders have concluded that they cannot wait until the Trump administration decides to deal more forcefully with Iran's growing use of Syria as a staging area for carrying out its expansionist Shiite Crescent strategy.\n“Their overriding concern in Syria is the free reign that all the major players there seem willing to afford Iran and its various proxies in the country,” wrote Jonathan Spyer in an article for Foreign Policy.\nAs long as nobody else is addressing the concern Iran’s growing control raises in a satisfactory manner, “Israel is determined to continue addressing it on its own.”\nAt least, Israel has a more sympathetic ear in the Trump administration than it did in the Obama administration for raising its concerns about Iran’s growing threat, not only to Israel but to U.S. interests in the region and beyond.\nPresident Trump’s sharp denunciation of the Iranian regime during his address to the UN General Assembly represented a welcome departure from the Obama administration’s milquetoast approach to Iran.\nAs the U.S.-led coalition continues to drive ISIS from its bases of operation in Syria, the Trump administration has proclaimed its intention not to allow Iran to turn Syria into its own satellite, as Iran has essentially done in Iraq.\nNational Security Adviser H.R.\nMcMaster said that the “so called liberation of areas by Assad’s forces and Iranian proxies could actually accelerate the cycle of violence and perpetuate conflict rather than get us to a sustainable outcome.” He claimed that the Trump administration’s “objectives are to weaken Iranian influence across the region broadly,” without discussing the means to accomplish those objectives.\nWhether the Trump administration follows through remains to be seen.\nIn the meantime, Israel will have to deal with the fallout of Iran’s ambitions in Syria itself.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"The Islamization of the Public Schools\n\nMuslims anxious to use schools and textbooks to proselytize for Islam have found a welcoming environment in American public schools that are indefatigably committed to multiculturalism.\nWith the imperative to be “tolerant” robbing many educators of their ability to evaluate non-Western cultures critically, all too many public schools and individual teachers have proven to be susceptible to an organized campaign by U.S.-based Islamic organizations and their primary benefactor, Saudi Arabia, to present a view of Islam that whitewashes its violent history and intolerant doctrines.\nMany of the Islamic groups that vet American public school textbooks for the accuracy of their material on Islamic doctrine and history are Saudi-funded.\nThey make sure that the Islamic instruction in these textbooks presents a picture of Islam that is so pristine and whitewashed that it sometimes crosses the boundary from mere pro-Muslim bias into outright Islamic proselytizing.\nThe taboo about teaching religion in the public schools, so zealously established and guarded against Christian prayer by the ACLU and the Supreme Court over the last few decades, is increasingly set aside in American public schools, as presentations on Islam frequently cross the line between teaching facts about the religion and teaching the religion as fact.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do

site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nWe have seen this just recently, when Mountain Ridge Middle School in Gerrardstown, West Virginia instructed students to copy out the Islamic profession of faith (shahada), ostensibly as a calligraphy exercise.\nParent Rich Penkoski recounted: “I saw the assignment of writing the Shahada in Arabic.\nTheir excuse was calligraphy.\nI was like, ‘Whoa!\nWhoa!\nWhoa!’ First of all, calligraphy was invented in China 3,000 years prior to Muhammad.\nThe fact that they were trying to get my daughter to write that disturbed me.\nI said, ‘That is not happening.\nMy daughter is not doing that.’ My daughter told me that if she didn’t do the assignment, then she was going to get a [detention] slip.”\nBranch contradicted Penkoski, claiming: “The teacher has told her class several times that this is a study of world religions and that she is not trying to advocate for any religion over another.\nShe has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs, that those conversations should take place with their parents.” He said that Christianity and Judaism were given “equitable treatment” in the same class.\nPenkoski’s daughter, Brielle, however, said that the class spent much less time on Christianity and Judaism than it did on Islam.\nPenkoski pointed out that the accompanying exercises were also less extensive for Christianity and Judaism than they were for Islam: “Notice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord’s Prayer.\n[There’s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet.”\nThis stealth proselytizing is nationwide.\nLast January, parents filed a federal complaint against Chatham Middle School in Chatham, New Jersey, for forcing students to watch videos that proselytized for Islam.\nOne video, according to the complaint, describes “Christians and Jews as ‘infidels’ and prais[es] Muhammad in gruesome detail for slaughtering them.” Parent Libby Hilsenrath characterized the accompanying assignment as “replete with biased, chastising statements encouraging the students…to follow the Quran and become Muslim.” Another video, according to Hilsenrath, depicts a Muslim boy teaching his non-Muslim friend about Islam, after which both go to “learn how to pray.”\nThe complaint adds: “Due to the fact that these doctrinal messages calling for conversion to Islam were included in video format with vivid images and text, they possess greater communicative impact and are more likely to be accepted by the students viewing them than information that is spoken in a classroom or even written in a book.”\nThese accounts are not singular.\nHigh school students in Newton, Massachusetts in October 2017, according to Fox News, “pretended to be Muslims in the ‘Islamic’ city of Jerusalem as part of a class assignment.” The assignment also included a pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel article.\nJudicial Watch Senior Investigator Bill Marshall remarked: “Citizens of Newton have been waging a minor war with school officials for years now, trying to get them to use balanced curriculum in their teaching materials on the subject of Islam and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” Dr. Bill Saxton, chairman of Citizens for National Security, said that the assignment was a “purposeful attempt to indoctrinate our impressionable high-schoolers with the ‘virtues’ of Islam at the expense of Christianity, Judaism and other religions.”\nMeanwhile, Georgia parent Michelle King noted in 2016: “My daughter had to learn the Shahid and the Five Pillars of Islam, which is what you learn to convert,” while not teaching Christianity or the Ten Commandments.\nOne homework assignment in Walton County, Georgia, stated: “Allah is the [blank] worshiped by Jews & Christians,” with students having to fill in the blank with “same God.”\nParent Steve Alsup added: “It seemed like half the truth to me, they didn’t talk about the extreme Islamics.” Kim Embry, a spokesperson for Walton County Public Schools, said revealingly: “We are teaching the same stuff that everyone else is teaching.”\nIndeed.\nIn 2015, students at Spring Hill Middle School in Spring Hill, Tennessee were forced as part of an assignment to write, “There is no god but Allah; Muhammad is his prophet.” Mother Joy Ellis remarked: “This is a seventh grade state standard, and will be on the TCAP.\nI didn’t have a problem with the history of Islam being taught, but to go so far as to make my child write the Shahada, is unacceptable.” Another mother, Brandee Porterfield, observed: “It really did bother me that they skipped the whole chapter on the rise of Christianity and they spent three weeks just studying Islam….I spoke with the teacher and the principal,” she said.\n“They are not going to learn any other religion, doctrines or creeds and they are not going back over this chapter.\nEven though they discuss Christianity a little bit during the Middle Ages, they are not ever going to have this basis for Judaism or Christianity later.”\nMaury County Director of Schools, Chris Marczak, defended the curriculum: “It is our job as a public school system to educate our students on world history in order to be ready to compete in a global society, not to endorse one religion over another or indoctrinate.” Porterfield, however, shot back: “They are not going over anything else.\nSo for the students to have to memorize this prayer, it does seem like it is indoctrination.”\nNone of the encroachments of Islam in public schools should come as any real surprise.\nMulticulturalism, after all, amounts to respect for every culture except one’s own.\nThe embarrassment, regret, and even self-hatred that has been inculcated in American public school students for decades now has created a vacuum, which Muslims have shown themselves to be all too eager to fill.\nCertainly, those who are furthering the Islamization of the schools would deny that they would like to see Islamic law implemented in the United States, and would indignantly reject the claim that their efforts were furthering that end in any way.\nThey would say that they are doing it all for tolerance, pluralism, and multiculturalism.\nUnfortunately, in the end, it amounts to the same thing.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Lawyer: Ammo dealer saw nothing suspicious in Vegas gunman\n\nAn Arizona man who sold ammunition to the gunman in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history was disturbed that he didn't spot any suspicious signs about his one-time customer, the man's lawyer said Wednesday.\nDouglas Haig had no reason to believe Stephen Paddock would launch the Oct. 1 shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people, attorney Marc Victor said.\nHe said Haig wishes he could have figured out the intentions of Paddock but defends the sale of ammunition as legal.\n\"He wishes there was some clue that could have identified him,\" Victor said.\n\"There was just nothing.\"\nMeanwhile, the coroner in Las Vegas started releasing redacted autopsy records about the 58 people killed in the mass shooting at an outdoor concert.\nRecords relating to Paddock were not being provided.\nThe records were released Wednesday in response to a public records lawsuit filed by The Associated Press and Las Vegas Review-Journal.\nHaig was named as a \"person of interest\" in the investigation by mistake Tuesday when court documents were released nearly four months after the shooting.\nThe documents did not disclose why authorities considered Haig a person of interest, and officials haven't said whether he has since been cleared of that designation.\nVictor said his client sold ammunition to Paddock once and doesn't believe they have communicated since.\n\"He is as connected (to Paddock) as the guy who sold him a hamburger for lunch,\" Victor said.\nLas Vegas police and officials with the FBI, U.S. attorney's office in Nevada and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives each declined Wednesday to comment about Haig or the investigation.\nA law enforcement official told The Associated Press in October that Paddock bought 1,000 rounds of tracer ammunition from a private seller he met at a Phoenix gun show three weeks before the shooting.\nThe official spoke anonymously because they weren't authorized to disclose case information.\nTracer bullets contain a pyrotechnic charge that illuminates the path of fired bullets so shooters can see whether their aim is correct.\nHaig told the AP on Tuesday that he sold unspecified ammunition to Paddock.\nHe also told \"CBS This Morning\" on Wednesday that he sold more than 700 rounds of ammunition to Paddock.\n\"I couldn't detect anything wrong with this guy,\" he said of Paddock.\nThe ammunition sale took place at Haig's home in Mesa, because he didn't have all the ammunition on hand that Paddock wanted while at the gun show.\nVictor said a box that Paddock used to carry ammunition out of Haig's house and bore his client's name was later found in the Las Vegas hotel where the attack was launched.\nIt's unknown whether the ammunition Haig sold to Paddock was used in the attack.\nThe lawyer said the type and quantity of ammunition Paddock bought from his client wasn't unusual.\nRobert Spitzer, an expert on firearms and the Second Amendment, said by and large there are no restrictions on the amount of ammunition a person can buy, but a large sale of tracer ammunition would certainly be unusual.\nOnly six states in the U.S. have laws requiring that ammunition buyers pass a background check.\nArizona and Nevada do not have such a requirement, nor do they mandate that dealers keep a record of ammunition transactions.\n\"If you are in the business of selling anything, you are usually happy to make the sale, and there's nothing that says you need to write down this person's name or report the sale,\" said Spitzer, who is the chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland.\nVictor said his client has cooperated with investigators who contacted him within 24 hours of the shooting and has spoken to them probably four or five times, though he hasn't talked to them in months.\nHaig describes himself as a senior engineer for Honeywell Aerospace in his biography on the professional and social media platform LinkedIn.\nRecords show Haig also owns Specialized Military Ammunition LLC.\nThe company's website says it sold tracer and incendiary ammunition but is now \"closed indefinitely.\"\nHaig's name was blacked out in the more than 270 pages of search warrant records released by a Nevada judge to the AP, but remained on one page of documents provided to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\nThe newspaper published the name online.\nClark County District Court Judge Elissa Cadish later ordered the full document not be published without redactions, but she acknowledged she couldn't order the newspaper to retract the name.\nHaig plans to hold a news conference Friday to discuss his interaction with Paddock.\nGarcia Cano reported from Las Vegas.\nAssociated Press writers Ken Ritter in Las Vegas and Anita Snow in Phoenix contributed to this report.\nBilleaud reported from Phoenix.\n>","completion":" Exaggeration,Minimisation|112|162\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1452|1494."}
{"prompt":"Madagascar Plague Outbreak Has Already Killed 57 And Infected Over 600\n\nAn outbreak of the plague in Madagascar is spreading at an unprecedented rate.\nWith the ease of spreading the plague, the likelihood that this disease will move to other more densely populated regions of the planet has become a huge concern for many.\nSo far, the plague has claimed 57 lives and infected more than 680 others.\nThese figures are from October 12, however, and the disease is spreading rapidly.\nAn estimated 329 of these cases and 25 of the deaths were in the capital city of Antananarivo.\nOf the 684 cases reported as of October 12, 474 were the pneumonic plague, 156 bubonic and 1 septicemic plague.\nA further 54 were unspecified, according to the World Health Organization.\nOf Madagascar’s 114 districts, 35 have reported cases of plague, including at least 10 cities.\nPlague is caused by infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis and is typically spread through the bite of infected fleas, frequently carried by rats.\nThe bacteria will eventually end up causing the often fatal plague.\nSymptoms can include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called buboes, as well as fever, chills, and coughing.\nPneumonic plague is more virulent or damaging and is an advanced form of the disease characterized by a severe lung infection.\nThe infection can be transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing.\nThe incubation period is extremely short too, and an infected person may die within 12 to 24 hours of contracting the bacteria making cures in underdeveloped regions of the globe difficult at best.\nAccording to CNN, the cases were reported by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Bureau for Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) in Madagascar.\nThey include probable and suspected cases as well those that have been confirmed by laboratory tests.\nAnd while the country experiences regular outbreaks, with an estimated 400 cases of plague each year, this time things are very different, experts warn.\nThis year, health officials report the infections started much earlier than usual, and they’re occurring in new areas, including urban settings.\nThey’ve also seen an unexpected number of cases of pneumonic plague, which transmits more easily from person to person.\nHistorically dubbed the “black death” the bubonic plague has been responsible for several worldwide pandemics in the past.\nEarly detection of the plague is key since both forms of it can be cured with antibiotics.\nBut, occasionally there can be cases of septicemic plague, where the infection has spread to a person’s bloodstream and can cause bleeding and necrosis of tissue, turning it black.\nInternationally, this outbreak is also being taken seriously.\nWHO delivered more than 1.2 million doses of antibiotics and released $1.5 million in emergency funds earlier this month.\nThe Red Cross has released more than $1 million to deploy a treatment center and has mobilized more than 1,000 volunteers and is upgrading their skills on community surveillance, finding and monitoring people who have been in contact with infected patients and insightful messaging to stop the spread of this disease.\n>","completion":" Bandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|300|321\nLoaded_Language|1440|1449\nLoaded_Language|131|144\nLoaded_Language|1594|1611\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|190|321\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1542|1611\nName_Calling,Labeling|2324|2335."}
{"prompt":"Pope admits Catholic Church has ‘long ignored’ problem of child abuse\n\nVATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Monday asked forgiveness for child abuse crimes and cover-ups within the Catholic Church, admitting that the pain of victims “was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced.”\nThe strongly worded statement came ahead of an Aug. 25-26 papal pilgrimage to Ireland, one of the countries rocked by clergy sex abuse scandals, and followed an expose of pedophile priests in the U.S.\n“The heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven, was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced,” Francis said in a Letter to the People of God, a rarely-issued address to the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics.\nOn Aug. 17, a Pennsylvania grand jury report, based on hidden archives of the U.S. church, named 301 priests from the state as credibly accused child sex abusers and accused church leaders of a systematic cover-up of their crimes.\nThe report “detailed the experiences of at least a thousand survivors, victims of sexual abuse, the abuse of power and of conscience at the hands of priests over a period of approximately seventy years,” Francis acknowledged.\n“It is essential that we, as a Church, be able to acknowledge and condemn, with sorrow and shame, the atrocities perpetrated by consecrated persons, clerics, and all those entrusted with the mission of watching over and caring for those most vulnerable,” he said.\n“Let us beg forgiveness for our own sins and the sins of others,” he added.\nIn the run-up to Francis’ visit to Ireland, the head of the Irish Catholic Church, Archbishop Eamon Martin, said he expected the pope to meet with victims of clergy sex abuse and to promise effective remedies.\n“I’m not sure what his words will be and I’m not sure that a simple apology is what survivors of abuse want,” Martin said in a BBC interview.\n“If he expresses an apology, it needs to be more than ‘we’re sorry,’” he added.\nIn his letter, Francis repeated a famous 2005 quote by his predecessor Benedict XVI, who, a month before being elected pope, lamented “how much filth” there was in the Catholic Church.\n“With shame and repentance, we acknowledge as an ecclesial community that we were not where we should have been, that we did not act in a timely manner, realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives.\nWe showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them,” Francis said.\n“Looking back to the past, no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient.\nLooking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated,” he added.\nColm O’Gorman, an Irish abuse survivor who founded One in Four, the main survivors’ group in Ireland, commented on Twitter that the pope offered “Much stronger language than ever used before.”\nBut O’Gorman added: “(The pope) begs for forgiveness, but still does not admit or own the deliberate policy of cover up designed & implemented by the #Vatican.”\nLike his predecessor, Francis has promised “zero tolerance” on child abuse, but scandals have kept recurring in several parts of the world — including in Australia recently.\nIn January, the pope was accused of insensitivity and tone-deafness after insisting, during a visit to Chile, that local abuse survivors had no “proof” against a bishop who allegedly witnessed abuse and failed to report it.\nFollowing an outcry, Francis apologized for his remarks, held private meetings with victims at the Vatican, and, after envoys he sent to Chile backed up victims’ claims, the entire leadership of the Chilean Catholic church tendered their resignations.\nAccording to church expert John L Allen, an editor at specialized website Crux.com, the Catholic Church has a structural problem when it comes to dealing with cover up accusations.\n“Sixteen years since the crisis first erupted in the U.S., almost ten years since that happened in Ireland, and now more than five years since Francis was elected, the Catholic Church still has no credible, transparent process for handling cases when the accusation against a bishop isn’t the direct commission of abuse but rather covering up someone else’s crimes,” Allen said in a Sunday column.\n— Alvise Armellini\ndpa\n———\n©2018 Deutsche Presse-Agentur GmbH (Hamburg, Germany), Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|822|856\nLoaded_Language|2059|2073\nLoaded_Language|473|497\nDoubt|2110|2395\nDoubt|3090|3262\nLoaded_Language|379|414\nLoaded_Language|516|541\nLoaded_Language|1227|1248\nDoubt|1703|1809\nDoubt|1845|1910\nLoaded_Language|2110|2135\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2439|2522\nDoubt|2951|3087\nLoaded_Language|3501|3507\nAppeal_to_Authority|3740|4317\nDoubt|4085|4285\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1153|1404\nDoubt|3824|3919\nLoaded_Language|3959|3966."}

{"prompt":"﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate\n\nBy now the whole Catholic world has heard of the publication of a devastating letter to Pope Francis from Father Thomas G. Weinandy.\nThe former head of the theological secretariat of the U.S. Bishop’s conference, Fr.\nWeinandy has taught at both Oxford and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.\nNone other than Francis appointed Fr.\nWeinandy to the International Theological Commission and awarded him the Pro Pontifice et Ecclesiae medal, the ecclesial equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, for his work on behalf of the Pope and the Church.\nOne of the world’s most renowned theologians, Fr.\nWeinandy is a “man of the Council” and a prominent figure of the post-conciliar mainstream.\nYet Fr.\nWeinandy’s letter, sent to Francis privately last summer but predictably ignored by him—along with every other private entreaty concerning his destructive activity—is a withering indictment of a papacy that constitutes nothing less than a menace to the Church.\nThe key passages (paragraph breaks added) rebuke Francis for his recklessness, his deliberate ambiguity, his fomenting of error, his sowing of disunity, his unheard-of calumnies of the faithful, and even his reduction of the faith to an ideology—precisely the wrong of which he accuses orthodox Catholics:\n\n\nYour Holiness, a chronic confusion seems to mark your pontificate….\nThis fosters within the faithful a growing unease ….\nIn \"Amoris Laetitia,\" your guidance at times seems intentionally ambiguous, thus inviting both a traditional interpretation of Catholic teaching on marriage and divorce as well as one that might imply a change in that teaching….\nTo teach with such a seemingly intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth.\nThe Holy Spirit is given to the Church, and particularly to yourself, to dispel error, not to foster it.\n[Y]ou seem to censor and even mock those who interpret Chapter 8 of \"Amoris Laetitia\" in accord with Church tradition as Pharisaic stone-throwers who embody a merciless rigorism.\nThis kind of calumny is alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry….\nSuch behavior gives the impression that your views cannotsurvive theological scrutiny, and so must be sustained by “ad hominem” arguments.\n[T]oo often your manner seems to demean the importance of Church doctrine.\nAgain and again you portray doctrine as dead and bookish, and far from the pastoral concerns of everyday life.\nYour critics have been accused, in your own words, of making doctrine an ideology.\nBut it is precisely Christian doctrine… that frees people from worldly ideologies and assures that they are actually preaching and teaching the authentic, life-giving Gospel.\nThose who devalue the doctrines of the Church [i.e., Francis!]\nseparate themselves from Jesus, the author of truth… What they [i.e., Francis] then possess, and can only possess, is an ideology – one that conforms to the world of sin and death.\n[F]aithful Catholics can only be disconcerted by your choice of some bishops, men who seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief but who support and even defend them.\nWhat scandalizes believers, and even some fellow bishops, is not only your having appointed such men to be shepherds of the Church, but that you also seem silent in the face of their teaching and pastoral practice….\nAs a result, many of the faithful, who embody the \"sensus fidelium,\" are losing confidence in their supreme shepherd.\n[T]he Church is one body, the Mystical Body of Christ, and you are commissioned by the Lord himself to promote and strengthen her unity.\nBut your actions and words too often seem intent on doing the opposite….\nYou have often spoken about the need for transparency within the Church.\nYou have frequently encouraged… all persons, especially bishops, to speak their mind and not be fearful of what the pope may think.\nBut… what many [bishops] have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it… Many fear that if they speak their mind, they will be marginalized or worse.\nI have often asked myself: \"Why has Jesus let all of this happen?\"\nThe only answer that comes to mind is that Jesus wants to manifest just how weak is the faith of many within the Church, even among too many of her bishops.\nIronically, your pontificate has given those who hold harmful theological and pastoral views the license and confidence to come into the light and expose their previously hidden darkness….\nFather Weinandy reveals that he decided to publicize this historic missive only after receiving an unmistakable sign from heaven.\nAs he recounts here, after repeatedly “beseeching Jesus and Mary, St. Peter and all of the saintly popes who are buried there to do something to rectify the confusion and turmoil within the Church today, a chaos and an uncertainty that I felt Pope Francis had himself caused,” he asked for a minutely specific sign from heaven on whether he should write the letter: that the next day he would meet someone he had not seen in a very long time, would never expect to see in Rome, and was not from the United States, Canada or Great Britain, which person would utter the particular phrase: “Keep up the good writing.”\n\nAt lunch the next day, the sign was given.\nAn old friend he had not seen in more than twenty years and would never have expected to meet in Rome, who is now an archbishop, appeared suddenly from between two parked cars, renewed acquaintances and, referring to one of Father Weinandy’s books, said: “Keep up the good writing.”\n\nWrites Fr.\nWeinandy: “I could hardly believe that this just happened in a matter of a few minutes.\nBut there was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something.\nI also think it significant that it was an Archbishop that Jesus used.\nI considered it an apostolic mandate.”\n\nCan we doubt that it was indeed an apostolic mandate?\nCan we not see in Fr.\nWeinandy a voice raised up by heaven itself to say, from deep within the post-conciliar ecclesial establishment, things that exceed in their candor what even certain traditionalist commentators have ventured to state?\nThis article is featured in the new Print\/E-edition of The Remnant.\nCheck out the PREVIEW and Subscribe Today!\nAs if to confirm the validity of his own indictment of this pontificate, only a day after this letter was published, the USCCB demanded that Fr.\nWeinandy resign his current position as a consultant to the U.S. bishops.\nHe has done so.\nFr.\nFessio’s Catholic World Report, another voice of the rising mainstream opposition to Francis, notes that “In making such a request, the USCCB, it would appear, reinforces Fr.\nWeinandy’s very point about fearfulness and lack of transparency.”\n\nFr.\nWeinandy’s intervention gives us hope that the plan to remake the Church according to the mind of Bergoglio will ultimately encounter a resistance that will bring an end to the Latin American-style dictatorship Francis has imposed upon the Church, even as he speaks of dialogue, collegiality, decentralization and parreshia (but only for those who agree with him).\nThe plan that ultimately must fail may well fail even while Francis is attempting to carry it out.\n\nMay Our Lady of Fatima intercede soon to thwart the designs of Francis and to rectify the grave harm he has already caused.\n\"We don't like you 'rigid' Catholics!\"\nPope Francis meets meets with Lutheran leader, Bishop Munib Younan, in Sweden\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II\n\nStill, we’re also averse to speaking in terms of good and evil.\nRight and wrong?\nMaybe.\nBut good and evil have a supernatural ring we usually reserve for dramatic and abominable crimes, like genocide.\nYet everything right is good, and everything wrong is evil.\nThe evils we encounter in our day-to-day lives might not be a spectacle, like jihadists beheading a journalist on live television.\nAll the same, evil is part of ordinary life.\nIt dwells deep in our hearts – each and every one of us.\nThe Prince of this World has made a grand display of his authority in the last few centuries.\nOur saving grace is that, while Westerners no longer believe in God, they still believe in the Devil.\nWe’re at least clear-eyed enough to recognize true evil at work in the world, even if we can no longer see the great Good hidden behind the veil.\nThis is the point about the McCarrick scandal that even religious commentators tend to overlook.\nHow was he allowed to go on molesting young priests and seminarians when virtually the entire Church hierarchy knew what he was up to?\nAnd how was such a depraved individual ordained in the first place, let alone promoted to Cardinal-Archbishop of Washington?\nThe answer is, ultimately, demonic.\nAs Catholics, we ask St. Michael to “cast into Hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls.” McCarrick and his fellow perverts in the clergy are responsible, not only for their sexual abuses, but also for chasing good men away from the priesthood.\nSpend enough time in Catholic World and you inevitably meet good men who quit the seminary because of some rampant (and often violent) depravity.\nWhat could suit the Devil more than to watch the Church burn her wheat as she gathers the chaff?\nThe gates of Hell will not prevail against the Church, as Our Lord promised.\nBut they won’t stop trying, either.\nThey’ve attacked from the front, sending the Roman pagans, French Revolutionaries, and British American secularists.\nThey flank us by sending heretics like Arius, Luther, and Hans Kung.\nToday, there’s also a fifth column working to tear down the walls from within – not only pedophiles like John Geoghan, but also predators like Theodore McCarrick.\nWhere did those fifth columnists enter?\nWhy, there’s only one possible explanation: the Second Vatican Council.\nAggiornamento sounds like a Lefebvrist slur.\nThe idea that an ecumenical council of the Catholic Church would openly seek to “bring itself up to date” is ridiculous.\nYet that was precisely the aim.\nAs St Pope John XXIII explained, “Its principal task will be concerned with the conditions and modernization of the Church after 20 centuries of life.” It was not supposed (as some have claimed) to simply update the liturgy from its last redesign in 1570.\nThe goal was to align the Church more with modern world: a world defined, to a considerable extent, by its rejection of the Catholic world that flourished before the Protestant Reformation and French Revolution.\nNow, I don’t believe Pope John saw himself as endangering either orthodoxy or sacred, immutable tradition.\nI share Pope Paul IV’s view.\nWhen he heard that the Council was being convened, then-Cardinal Montini is supposed to have sighed, “This holy old boy doesn’t realise what a hornet’s nest he’s stirring up.”\nNonetheless, he stirred it.\nThe spirit of aggiornamento quickly spread through the Church in the 1960s – and the seminaries especially.\nSeminarians called for a more “participatory” administration.\nThey became involved in socialist politics.\nThey formed trade unions to demand the right to marry.\nThey practiced sauvage intercommunion.\nOf course, they had their enablers in the hierarchy as well.\nPerhaps the worst was Archbishop Marty of Paris, a leader of the “priest-worker movement” who defended Marxist and existentialist atheisms on the floor of the Council.\nDuring a homily at the Cathedral, he also praised the soixantehuitards: “the great outburst of the younger generation that suddenly wanted to take its place in life” that occurred in his city in May of 1968.\n“One also felt that, in these events of May,” Marty continued, “the seriousness of the working class, which wants not only to earn a living wage, but also to find its freedom, its independence.” Theaggiornamentistas was never purged from the Church, and certainly not from the seminaries.\nAs the modern world continued to reject traditional Christian mores, so too does the Church seem increasingly “out of step” and in need of “modernizing”.\nInevitably, this came to mean the acceptance of homosexuality.\nBishop Wilton D. Gregory, as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, infamously spoke of “an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.”\nBut that predominance has very little to do with homosexuality per se.\nRather, the 1960s rejection of celibacy in the seminaries naturally provided more (shall we say) opportunities for gay men – given that there are, of course, no women in Catholic seminaries.\nThis began driving away heterosexuals, as well as homosexuals who upheld the Church’s teachings on chastity and celibacy.\nNeedless to say, not all gay priests are violent predators like McCarrick.\nBut the toleration of sexually active priests gave McCarrick cover to “seduce” his victims.\nMany have also speculated that, because McCarrick’s victims were overwhelmingly above the age of consent, the media didn’t consider them newsworthy.\nIf he’d fondled a 12-year old altar boy, that would have been one thing.\nPedophile priests sell papers.\nBut taking an 18-year-old seminarian to bed?\nRunning that story would simply be outing a closeted gay man: an act the liberal press would no doubt consider “homophobic”, as Ross Douthat pointed out.\nMeanwhile, those bishops who didn’t approve of his actions knew the culture – both within the Church and without her – were against them.\nThe post-Vatican Church doesn’t like to come off as a nag.\nShe’s not going to cause a fuss by purging sexually active gay men from the clergy just because… what?\nIt’s immoral?\nThat’s not very aggiornamentistic!\nThe world and our worldly bishops were, unsurprisingly, of one mind.\nAnd even if they were disgusted by McCarrick, these prelates weren’t willing to jeopardize their careers by standing for justice against vice.\nWe seem to be slouching back to the old traditionalist trope: All the Church’s problems would be solved if we’d just go back to the Latin Mass.\nSomething went critically wrong during Vatican II that extends well beyond the Mass.\nAnd we can’t drag the Church out of her present crisis until we have the courage to brave accusations of “Lefebvrism” and say so.\nThose who love our Holy Mother – those who want to protect her boys and men from all the McCarricks and their perverse appetites – mustn’t be deceived into thinking this is a small or an isolated issue.\nIt isn’t.\nThis is the crisis of an ancient and immortal institution trying desperately to seem young and fashionable; like all old men, it only manages to come across as lecherous and pathetic.\nIts obsession with “modernization” leads it to only adopt the vices of modernity.\nInstead of serving as ambassadors from the City of God, far too many of our priests and prelates have become agents of the City of Man.\nI don’t know what it will take to set things right.\nI don’t know what it will take to exorcise the “spirit of Vatican II” – the spirit of aggiornamento – from the Church.\nBut we will.\nChrist promised.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|1282|1289\nLoaded_Language|1453|1461\nLoaded_Language|6893|6901\nLoaded_Language|7156|7178\nLoaded_Language|1690|1697\nName_Calling,Labeling|3309|3321\nLoaded_Language|229|239\nLoaded_Language|253|261\nLoaded_Language|1149|1157\nCausal_Oversimplification|2333|2370\nLoaded_Language|5633|5662\nLoaded_Language|6583|6599\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|263|321\nName_Calling,Labeling|560|580\nName_Calling,Labeling|2253|2262\nLoaded_Language|5285|5302\nName_Calling,Labeling|5753|5769\nRepetition|7450|7480\nSlogans|7573|7580."}

{"prompt":"San Francisco Show Trial Sequel\n\nLast week, a San Francisco jury acquitted seven-time felon Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a repeatedly deported Mexican national, of all murder and manslaughter charges in the July 1, 2015, fatal shooting of Kate Steinle as she walked with her father and a friend on Pier 14.\nThe jury found the confessed shooter guilty only of felony gun possession.\nMany observers decried the verdict as a travesty of justice, but they were mistaken if they thought it could not get any worse.\nSan Francisco public defender Matt Gonzalez now seeks to have Zarate’s gun possession charge dismissed.\nGonzalez is contending the jury should have been told that “momentary” possession of a gun is not necessarily a crime.\n“If you possess it just to dispose of it or abandon it, it wouldn’t be a crime,” Gonzalez told reporters.\nThe Steinle family and relatives of murder victims have new cause for outrage, but this gambit is consistent with Gonzalez and the San Francisco show-trial in which he co-starred.\nGonzalez hails from McAllen, Texas, and attended Columbia University on a scholarship.\nAs he explained, “I think I was a product of affirmative action,” and ethnic preferences doubtless played a role in admission to Stanford Law School.\nIn San Francisco, Gonzalez became known as “The Great Left Hope,” and a hero to Bay Area radicals.\nThe La Raza Lawyers Association named Gonzalez Lawyer of the Year, and the Mexican American Political Association, a group with roots in the Communist Party, gave him the Bert Corona award, after one of the CPUSA’s most high-profile Stalinists.\nIn 2,000, after a decade as a public defender, Gonzalez gained election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\nIn 2003, as board president, he commissioned a graffiti artist to spray SMASH THE STATE on his office wall, in “traffic cone orange.” As Gonzalez explained, “This is a sentiment I think all of us have had.\nYou have to rally and find ways of opposing what you don’t like.”\nIn 2003 Gonzalez ran for mayor of San Francisco but lost to Gavin Newsom.\nIn 2008 Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader tapped Gonzalez for vice president.\n“He has a great, steadfast commitment to justice,” Nader told reporters.\nOn that score, the Steinle family and other relatives of murder victims have room for reasonable doubt.\nIn jury selection, Gonzalez and the prosecutor, assistant district attorney Diana Garcia, included three “immigrants,” quite possibly false-documented illegals.\nTrue to form, judge Samuel Feng sealed the identities of the jurors.\nSo observers have grounds to believe that Garcia and Gonzalez both got the jury they wanted.\nGarcia told the court Zarate was playing his own “secret version of Russian roulette,” and thus parroted the defense’s contention that the shooting was all a matter of chance.\nAs it happens, in Russian roulette a shooter loads one bullet into a six-shot revolver, spins the cylinder, then puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger.\nIn a central fact of the case, Zarate did not aim the gun at himself but fired in the direction of Kate Steinle.\nIn another established fact, the bullet struck her in the lower back and tore through her abdominal aorta.\nThis happened in broad daylight, but as in In the Heat of the Night, they had the body which was dead.\nGarcia Zarate confessed to firing the shot and had gunpowder residue on his hands.\nAfter firing, he tossed the gun in the water.\nHe said he had found the stolen weapon wrapped in a cloth and that it discharged by itself, both utterly unbelievable claims.\nEven so, the politically correct jury found the career criminal not guilty of murder and manslaughter.\nAny observer could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted.\nUnlike Stalin’s trials of the old Bolsheviks, and Fidel Castro’ trial of General Arnaldo Ochoa, this show trial aimed to establish innocence for the guilty, and the dynamics of the left were on full display.\nDenunciations of “gun violence” were nowhere in evidence and expressions of sympathy for the Steinle family proved pathetically weak.\nAs Arthur Koestler said, on the left the truth is spoken with loathing and falsehood with love.\nOn the left, as Orwell had it in Animal Farm, rats are comrades, and criminals are victims of capitalist society.\nIn the view of Gonzalez, society is progressing toward a social justice paradise ruled by a wise elite that knows what’s best for all.\nIn this inexorable progress, determined by history, some people are going to have to die.\nAs Bertolt Brecht told Sidney Hook about Stalin’s victims, “the more innocent they are, the more they deserve to be shot.”\nOut for a summer-day walk with her father and a friend, Kate Steinle was a completely innocent victim, gunned down by a career criminal who was not even supposed to be in the country but found special protection in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, part of the sanctuary state of California.\nAs defense attorney Francisco Ugarte said, the verdict was a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”\nSince Donald Trump mentioned the case, former vice-presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez had to establish the complete innocence of the shooter.\nThat explains the effort of “The Great Left Hope” to have his client’s felony gun possession conviction tossed.\nAny observer of the case could believe it probably will be.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions\n\nNewsCatholic Church\nSALZBURG, Austria, February 13, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – The indignation about Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode – the President and the Vice President of the German Bishops' Conference – and their direct or more indirect encouragement of blessing homosexual unions is growing by the day.\nNow Bishop emeritus Andreas Laun – one of the signatories of the Kazakh “Profession of Truth about Sacramental Marriage” – has written a strong commentary for the Austrian Catholic news website Kath.net on the recent episcopal initiatives coming out of Germany.\nIn the following, we shall present to our readers the essential parts of Bishop Laun's statement, in our English translation from the German.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode, there is only one Catholic answer: No!\nAnd your addition “in individual cases” is absolutely worthless, it has no argumentative force.\nA clear statement by Bishop Andreas Laun for Kath.net.\nCardinal Marx and also Bishop Bode have now opened up to the idea to offer homosexual couples a blessing.\nWhy not, one could say, since the Church is ready to bless nearly everything on the earth?\nNow, the Church especially blesses people, but also deeds and objects.\nThe Jesuit Father Eckhard Bieger writes in the Internet about Catholic blessings:\nFor Catholics, really everything can be blessed, not only places of worship, chalices, and the faithful after each prayer service – whether after a Mass, or after the prayers for the hours of the day.\nThe blessing is also not limited to rosaries or religious medal, but one may also bless cars, factory halls, animals, herbs, and much more.\nSome blessings are only to be made by priests and deacons, especially when it is about objects of worship such as chalices or vestments.\nBut parents can bless their children.\nThe faithful may also take home holy water and sprinkle it on members of the family, but also the stable and the animals, thus blessing them.\n[...]\nWhat kind of hope is connected with a blessing?\nWith regard to the car, certainly the wish for heavenly protection – sometimes also expressed with the help of a medal of St. Christopher, the patron saint of car drivers.\nWith the weather blessing, one prays explicitly for protection against hail, lightning and drought.\n[…]\nTo bless always means that something shall flourish, because only then when there is a blessing upon a cause or a project, will something good come out of it.\nThe blessing comes from God, He is being addressed in the form of a request; and it is given to people, objects, and buildings, with the help of the sign of the cross, holy water, and incense.\n[…]\nBut now concerning the question of Cardinal Marx, and not a few of the priests, the answer is simple: one may ask for God's blessing for sinners, but not for the sin.\nThat is to say, one could not consecrate a brothel, one could not bless a concentration camp or weapons which are not explicitly ordained for hunting or for legitimate self-defense.\nTherefore it is clear that one may not bless a relationship which is sinful; [one may not bless] the mafia; no blessing for organizations or institutions which promote or procure abortions or which propagate ideologies which are against the Faith, antisemitic contents, or other forms of racist thought.\nIf one considers and weighs this matter, one knows: one may not bless a union of two homosexual men or of lesbian women.\nOf course [one could bless] two men or women who are de facto homosexual, and that it what happens in each Holy Mass which is being attended by them.\nThis blessing – which is not related to their acts – is being received also by all the other sinners, and the Church thereby hopes that they will convert under the influence of God's Grace!\nThis position which is really simple and easily to be understood has been clearly and convincingly presented – since the statement of the two bishops [Marx and Bode] – by several Christians: by Archbishops Ludwig Schick (Germany) and Charles Chaput (USA);

but if it does not [allow it], it would certainly be a hope for their conversion.\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_fear-prejudice|5353|5419\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|955|993\nLoaded_Language|998|1088\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1251|1341\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|2544|2640\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|3006|3186\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|3215|3490\nCausal_Oversimplification|3492|3611\nThought-terminating_Cliches|3953|4017\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|4279|4361\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|4404|4442\nExaggeration,Minimisation|5659|5889\nAppeal_to_Authority|5891|5970\nLoaded_Language|5353|5419\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|1251|1341\nCausal_Oversimplification|2483|2640\nRepetition|4357|4537\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|5891|5969."}
{"prompt":"Google colluded with Clinton campaign with ‘silent donations’\n\nWhile the establishment continues to push the notion that a couple hundred thousand dollars of ad spends and some Russian bots on Facebook swayed the election to Donald Trump, more proof of real “collusion” between Google and the Hillary Clinton campaign has been uncovered.\nAnd Google likely violated federal election laws — not to mention the privacy of its users — in the services it provided the Clinton campaign.\nFox News’ Tucker Carlson read an internal email on Monday night’s show that outlined in a Google’ executive’s own words how the company was providing a “silent donation” to a group that was creating ads and donating funds to bus Latinos to voting stations in key swing states.\nThe email was sent by Eliana Murillo, the former head of Google’s multicultural marketing department.\nThe email was forwarded to Google vice presidents and other staff members throughout the company, Carlson said.\nAccording to Carlson:\nIn her email, Mario touts Google’s multi-faceted efforts to boost Hispanic turnout in the election.\nShe noticed that Latino voters did record-breaking numbers, especially in states like Florida, Nevada and Arizona — the last of which she describes as “a key state for us.” She brags that the company used its power to ensure that millions of people saw certain hashtags and social media impressions, with the goal of influencing their behavior during the election.”\nMurillo also brags that Google, “used its power to ensure that millions of people saw certain hashtags and social media impressions, with the goal of influencing their behavior during the election.” Unfortunately for Clinton and Google, as Murillo lamented, “…ultimately after all was said and done, the Latino community did come out to vote, and completely surprised us.\nWe never anticipated that 29% of Latinos would vote for Trump.\nNo one did.”\nThe assistance Google provided to the Clinton campaign likely violated election laws and served as an unreported in-kind contribution.\nOf course, anyone who paid attention was aware of Google’s attempts to interfere on Clinton’s behalf.\nWikiLeaks’ Julian Assange revealed two years ago that Google CEO Eric Schmidt and a number of Google employees created a company in 2015 specifically to place Clinton the White House.\nEmails obtained by WikiLeaks showed correspondence between Schmidt and Clinton, along with a number of Clinton operatives discussing strategy meetings and campaign ideas.\nAmong the strategies was the creation of a voter tracking database using smart phones.\nA report by a research team earlier this year found that Google can manipulate opinions of undecided voters by inserting negative search suggestions under the name of a candidate.\nMeanwhile, Trump took to Twitter early Tuesday morning to note the Department of Justice’s inaction over the fact that disgraced anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok and his mistress were engaged in a “media leak strategy” to plant negative stories which were then used to secure FISA warrants to spy on the Trump campaign.\nNew Strzok-Page texts reveal “Media Leak Strategy.” @FoxNews So terrible, and NOTHING is being done at DOJ or FBI – but the world is watching, and they get it completely.\n— Donald J.

Gottlieb.\n“For years, anti-gunners have contended that modern semi-automatic sport-utility rifles are so-called ‘weapons of war,’ and with this settlement, the government has acknowledged they are nothing of the sort.\n“Under this settlement,” he continued, “the government will draft and pursue regulatory amendments that eliminate ITAR control over the technical information at the center of this case.\nThey will transfer export jurisdiction to the Commerce Department, which does not impose prior restraint on public speech.\nThat will allow Defense Distributed and SAF to publish information about 3-D technology.” The Second Amendment Foundation (www.saf.org) is the nation’s oldest and largest tax-exempt education, research, publishing and legal action group focusing on the Constitutional right and heritage to privately own and possess firearms.\nFounded in 1974, The Foundation has grown to more than 600,000 members and supporters and conducts many programs designed to better inform the public about the consequences of gun control.\nWhat does all this mean?\nWell, it's pretty simple, and I highly recommend the Wired article, which is quite lengthy and has lots of information, but what this does is demonstrates that the genie is out of the bottle and there is just no way for gun grabbing Communists the world over to be able to truly enforce their unlawful acts of fun gun confiscation.\nWhy?\nBecause now, anyone with access to the internet and a 3D printer can print their very own gun that is unregistered.\nThat's right, and it's perfectly legal to do so.\nAnd we aren't just talking a rigid looking one-shot handgun.\nWe're talking ARs, 1911s and a host of other guns.\nThis actually may end up undermining the gun manufacturing industry in the future, as people will be able to build their own guns at home in a similar manner to how the internet has had a dramatic effect on the retail brick and mortar stores.\nWilson boasted that his efforts have officially killed gun control.\n\"I barely put a million bucks into this and I got you the Second Amendment forever,\" he told The Daily Wire in a phone interview.\n\"What has the NRA done for you lately?\"\nI don't know that I would go quite that far, after all, the settlement does state that \"the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber – including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms – are not inherently military.\"\nTherefore, the government still believes it has a right to regulate certain arms, which it does not have authority to do.\n\"This doesn’t put the rifle in everyone’s hand, but it does that in essence\" he added.\n\"The DNA of our culture is preserved.\nThis is the first pillar in the internet gun culture of tomorrow, and it is permanent.\"\nThis is a huge milestone in the history of our county, and as such, it should be celebrated as a victory.\nAs Joe Wolverton of The New American writes:\n>","completion":" Exaggeration,Minimisation|1714|1740\nLoaded_Language|6650|6680\nName_Calling,Labeling|6710|6733\nDoubt|7546|7582\nLoaded_Language|5318|5336\nLoaded_Language|249|266\nCausal_Oversimplification|1647|1711\nName_Calling,Labeling|1987|1999\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2377|2445\nThought-terminating_Cliches|3195|3224\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3857|3958\nAppeal_to_Authority|6516|6608\nLoaded_Language|6800|6820\nLoaded_Language|7354|7361\nExaggeration,Minimisation|7367|7413\nExaggeration,Minimisation|7416|7497\nFlag-Waving|8091|8213\nExaggeration,Minimisation|8216|8269\nName_Calling,Labeling|108|198\nName_Calling,Labeling|4547|4614."}

yet, nearly a month after the Las Vegas Strip experienced the worst mass shooting in modern American history, local and federal authorities are refusing to fill in the blanks.\nIt wasn’t always like this.\nIn the days after Oct. 1, when Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest festival crowd from his Mandalay Bay corner suite, Las Vegas police were hosting multiple news conferences a day.\nThen, once a day.\nThen, once every few days.\nThey compiled and released snippets of officers’ body camera footage.\nThey spent several minutes answering specific questions.\nThey released a comprehensive timeline, which ended up being wrong.\nThey took it back, and tried to clarify the errors, but instead caused more confusion.\nBy Oct. 13 — the last time the Metropolitan Police Department or the FBI addressed the media or public — something had changed.\nThe sheriff, who had been straightforward and stern, was now emotional and at times combative.\nBoth he and the FBI failed to provide much new information, and at the end of the meeting, they refused to take questions.\nSince that day, the only person who has shed more light on the investigation is Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, who was shot in the leg while approaching the gunman’s room.\nHis platform to share that information?\n“The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” which aired last week.\nHe hasn’t made himself available to the media since.\n“It doesn’t matter,” FBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Thursday, when asked why there had been no significant updates in two weeks.\n“It’s an ongoing investigation, and unless there’s something to report, there will not be a briefing.” Calls to the national FBI office were forwarded back to Breault at the Las Vegas office.\nAt least twice this week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal has asked to speak with Sheriff Joe Lombardo about the shooting investigation.\nBoth times, reporters were told by Carla Alston, the Police Department’s director of communications, that the sheriff “will not be conducting interviews.” “As he has stated previously, the case is still ongoing” she said in an email Thursday.\n“Another media briefing will be held when we have new and accurate information.” When asked when that briefing would be, Alston guessed it could occur in the next two weeks.\nThe Review-Journal also specifically asked about the more than 50,000 hours of overtime that Metro officers have logged since Oct. 1 on work directly related to the shooting investigation.\n“Investigators have made progress on investigative leads and in mapping out Stephen Paddock’s life for the last few years — and they’re still not done,” Alston said.\n“We still have officers dedicated to this case 24\/7.” She agreed that members of the public have a right to know more, “but they have a right to accurate information and not the speculation … that has filled so many news stories the past month.” Nearly a month after the mass shooting, the gunman’s motive remains a mystery.\nMore straightforward questions also remain unanswered, including whether the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay — where the gunman was staying — has surveillance cameras, and what exactly investigators collected in the gunman’s hotel room and homes.\nAuthorities also have not said how long the gunman had a “do not disturb” sign on his hotel door, and whether hotel staff saw something suspicious in his room but failed to report it.\nThough authorities have described the investigation as a team effort, they have not explained what role Las Vegas police, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are playing in the case.\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller.\nPamela Geller's commitment to freedom

{"prompt":"The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)\n\nTO ARGUE AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY is to contend with constituted reality.\nEver since Adam and Eve committed the Original Sin, every living creature is subject to it.\nEvery one of us is born on Death Row and lives out his allotted lifespan in its shadow without hope of reprieve.\nGod made that clear when He told Adam that “in what day soever” he preferred his own will above his Creator’s, “thou shalt die the death,” condemning him sooner or later to “return to the earth out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return” (Gen. 3:19).\nIn other words, there has always been a death penalty.\nGod instituted it, and He was the first to impose it, embedding it in the very fabric of natural law.\nWhen Cain took it upon himself to inflict death on his brother Abel “in the field,” he soon learned that God furthermore reserved the exercise of this right to himself alone.\nCain is told, “What hast thou done?\nThe voice of thy brother’s blood crieth to me from the earth,” and God curses him for his presumption by dooming him to homelessness and unproductive labor.\nWhen Cain complains that being a “vagabond .\n.\n.\non the earth, every one therefore that findeth me, shall kill me,” God laid down that “whoever shall kill Cain shall be punished sevenfold,” setting a mysterious identifying mark on him to protect him from the vengeance of others.\nThe Fifth Commandment later delivered to Moses, “Thou shalt not kill,” therefore dates from adamic times, when it operated as God’s exclusive prerogative, allowing no exceptions.\n\nAlthough men certainly continued to kill one another in a society which in fact became so wicked \"that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times,\" they did so as murderers, outside God's law without legal right.\nOnly after the Flood, when Noah and his sons set about repopulating the earth, did God delegate to human society His exclusive authority to impose the death penalty for just cause.\nHe told Noah, “For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man.\nWhosoever shall shed man’s blood, his blood shall be shed: for man was made to the image of God.” In other words, from that point in history lawful killing in atonement for taking the life of another is sanctioned by God.\n\nAfter the great theophany on Sinai, Moses codified the death penalty as part of the old law of talion, which in strict justice required “life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot” (Deut.\n19:21).\nThe supreme penalty was imposed not only for murder, but for many other serious offenses: for adultery, rape, sodomy, kidnapping, for striking or cursing parents, for sacrificing a child to Moloch.\nIdolatry, fortune-telling, acting as a medium, preaching apostasy or attempting in any way to entice another from the faith were also punishable by death, as was blasphemy, an offense considered so heinous that the Law specified, “He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die: all the multitude shall stone him, whether he be a native or a stranger” (Lev.\n24:16).\nDeath was also decreed for refusing to accept the decision of the priests in a legal case, and an incorrigible son could be put to death on the testimony of his parents before the proper court.\n\nA priest’s daughter convicted of fornication was burned to death (Lev.\n21:9), but usually the sentence was carried out by stoning, in which the whole community took part as evidence that no private parties were authorized to execute a criminal, but only society as a whole, after due judgment.\nEveryone was furthermore responsible for the atonement due to God for a crime whose evil consequences would otherwise have affected them all: “The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people; that thou mayest take away the evil out of the midst of thee” (Deut.\n17:7).\nThe Law read, “Defile not the land of your habitation which is stained with the blood of the innocent: neither can it otherwise be expiated, but by his blood that hath shed the blood of another” (Num.\n35:33).\n\nIn order to emphasize the fact that it is God, and not man, who is always the principal party to be avenged, provision was made for a heifer to be killed as propitiation in the case of an unsolved murder whose perpetrator could not be found (Deut.\n20:1-9).\nAfter all, it is not the injury to relatives or any other human consideration that makes homicide the serious sin that it is, but as God Himself pointed out to Noah, it is the fact that “man was made to the image of God” that makes an assault on him tantamount to an assault on God.\nIt is therefore to God, and not to His creatures that reparation is primarily due.\nThis point was brought out by Pope Pius XII in an address to Italian Catholic jurists on May 12, 1954, when he said:\nA penalty is the reaction required by law and justice in response to a fault: penalty and fault are action and reaction.\nOrder violated by a culpable act demands the reintegration and re-establishment of the disturbed equilibrium .\n.\n.\n.\nA word must be said on the full meaning of penalty.\nMost of the modern theories of penal law explain penalty and justify it in the final analysis as a means of protection, that is, defense of the community against criminal undertakings, and at the same time an attempt to bring the offender to observance of the law.\nIn those theories, the penalty can include sanctions such as the diminution of some goods guaranteed by law, so as to teach the guilty to live honestly, but those theories fail to consider the expiation of the crime committed, which penalizes the violation of the law as the prime function of penalty .\n.\n.\n.\nIn the metaphysical order, penalty is a consequence of dependence on the supreme will, dependence which exists in the deepest recesses of created being.\nIf it is ever necessary to hold back the revolt of the free being and re-establish the violated law, it is when that is required by the supreme Judge and supreme Justice.\nToday the death penalty is imposed ever more rarely, even in cases of proven premeditated murder.\nDespite the fact that it was instituted by God Himself, growing numbers of Catholics actually consider it immoral.\nJohn Paul II, stopping just short of declaring it wrong in principle, has declared that it should be imposed very seldom, if ever.\nBut doesn’t admitting the penalty in principle demand that it be put into practice?\nIn the U.S., following the lead of the late Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago and like minded prelates won to the new man-centered conciliar religion, the faithful are beginning to equate abortion, nuclear war and capital punishment as common “threats to the sacredness of human life” without any reference whatever to the innocence or guilt involved.\nIf they are aware that the Church has upheld from Apostolic times the right to use force in self-defense, to kill in a just war and to inflict the death penalty on those duly judged guilty of serious crime, they now apparently subscribe to the notion propagated by Dei Verbum at the Second Vatican Council that the unchanging Catholic “tradition which comes from the Apostles” actually “develops in the Church” and keeps pace with changing times (II,8).\n\nThe circumstances pertaining to our day would therefore dictate a reassessment of the death penalty, which the new man-centered theology insists on viewing almost exclusively from the standpoint of the criminal and human society rather than from God’s.\nAt the same time, there is more and more discussion about society’s responsibility for having produced criminals in the first place, together with our moral obligation to rehabilitate them rather than to wreak what is now considered a form of fruitless, guilty “vengeance” on them.\nThe idea that man is by nature good and perfectible is allowed to override all documented evidence that hardened criminals are in fact almost impossible to rehabilitate and that those handed life sentences rarely repent of their wrongdoing.\n\nAccording to one widely held opinion, the death penalty has proved to be no effective deterrent to crime in any case, and should be discarded as impractical.\nWhat proof of this can possibly be offered?\nHow can we know?\nDeterrence from evil is not the primary purpose of meting out punishment in any case, yet Scripture attests to deterrence as an important side effect of any penalty.\nTo a man proven to have given false witness against another, Deuteronomy laid down, “They shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother.\n.\n.\nthat others hearing may fear and may not dare to do such things.\nThou shalt not pity him, but shalt require life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot” (Deut.\n19:19-21).\nAnd the Preacher notes that when “sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the children of men commit evils without any fear” (Eccles.\n8:11).\n\nTo illustrate how shallow Catholic thinking on the death penalty has become and how far it has deviated from the age-old doctrine of the Church, a priest of a presumably traditional Catholic Fraternity writes in answer to a query addressed to him on the subject by saying:\nThe death penalty is based on the common teachings of theologians, but is not itself a declared dogma.\nTherefore it is not permissible to call those who hold it is, immoral heretics.\nTo approach this as a dogmatic teaching is imprudent.\nThose who argue for its abolition do not necessarily put society in danger considering possibilities of penal systems.\nThose, however, who maintain its continued use often see it more as a tool for revenge.\nPlease consider that in anger and tragedy, the desire for revenge usually overrides reason and an honest answering of the question “must this person’s life be taken to preserve society?” The desire for swift and firm convictions has sent many to death who never deserved such a punishment, nor was such a punishment truly necessary for the safety of society.\nI do not believe the death penalty is necessary in 90 percent of the cases where it is applied.\nThus to call for a moratorium .\n.\n.\nis not unjust or incorrect.\nThat the death penalty can become an instrument of revenge, and that unjust sentences are sometimes handed down can be dismissed as irrelevant to the argument.\nGiven the fallen human condition, such injustices are bound to occur in any judicial system, and everyone agrees that they should be ruthlessly remedied.\nWhat is not irrelevant is that the author of the letter falls headlong into the very error Pius XII warns against.\nConsidering the physical safety of society as the only real reason for executing a criminal, he feels the death penalty can now be safely discarded, allegedly on the grounds that we now have at our disposal many better ways of protecting people from him.\nThat the penalty is due primarily as expiation to God in justice, and only secondarily to man has been lost sight of altogether.\nThe supernatural dimension of the punishment as an agent for the spiritual good of both society and the criminal is furthermore not only not addressed, but treated as non-existent.\nThis first appeared in The Remnant nearly 20 years ago.\nIsn't it time to subscribe to the 'paper of record' for the traditional Catholic counterrevolution?\n\nThe source of this kind of materialistic thinking in the Church is not hard to trace.\nAccording to statistics published in the National Review for September 16, 1983, out of 9,140 murders committed in the U.S. in 1960 just before the Council, 56 persons were executed.\nIn 1965, the year the Council closed, although the tally of murders had risen to 9,850, only 7 were executed.\nIn the decade from 1967 to 1977 a moratorium was declared during which not one single execution took place.\nAt its close the number of murders had more than doubled, and in any six month period, more Americans were being murdered than those executed during the whole course of the century.\nAt this point, although the murder rate has continued to rise dramatically, executions continue to be rare.\nMany nations, notably England, France, Sweden, South Africa and our neighbors Canada and Mexico, have abolished the death penalty altogether.\nWhether or not the U. S. will follow suit and outlaw it nationally still remains to be seen.\n\nWhat leaps to the eye from the mounting statistics is that decline in the exercise of the death penalty has kept close pace with decline in the Faith and church attendance.\nIt is sober fact that death sentences were liberally handed out in the heyday of Christendom, when the Faith was strong and governments legislated with an eye to the spiritual welfare of citizens whose sights were primarily on future bliss in heaven.\nIn modern times, which find the Church strictly separated from the state on principle and denied any active part in civil government, secularism has become the state religion, directing legislation exclusively to temporal objectives.\nIt is only to be expected that materialists—for whom the immortal soul does not exist and who believe that this present life of the senses on earth is the only one man has—should be reluctant to punish anyone by killing him.\nIn their eyes this means total extinction, a penalty certainly in excess of any transgression of which he may be guilty.\n\nNot even God completely obliterates a human existence, not even for the most odious sins, for He made the human soul immortal and hell eternal.\n(It might be argued, however, that if the criminal is thought to have to have totally terminated his victim, why not do the same to him?)\nIn the days of Christendom, condemned criminals were given every opportunity to make their peace with God, in many cases the date of execution being delayed in order to accomplish this purpose.\nJustice was served, but not at the expense of charity, and there was no question of taking vengeance on the culprit.\nNor was the idea of “rehabilitation” with possible re-entry into society ever entertained where crimes deserving death were concerned.\nIt has been noted by prison chaplains in our century that swift execution in most cases leads to admission of guilt and sincere repentance, whereas those who receive life sentences or suffer long delays are likely to maintain their innocence in hopes of a parole and eventually die in their sins.\n\nAs it is, the death penalty as administered by society must be viewed against the backdrop of divine revelation if it is to make any real sense.\nWhen Catholic society puts a man to death, it terminates only his temporal life on earth, catapulting him into eternity for his final judgment before almighty God.\nSuffering the penalty not only allows the criminal to render expiation to God and to society, but if accepted in Christ’s grace with due repentance, it preserves his soul from hell and eliminates much of his purgatory.\nIf his contrition is perfect, it’s conceivable that he could go straight to heaven!\nIn any case, neither he nor society is any longer burdened with the guilt of his wrongdoing.\n\nAs Michel Martin pointed out in an article in Rome et d’Ailleurs for September-October 1983, “The truth is that the problem of the death penalty is insoluble except from a Christian point of view.” That it figured so prominently in Christian societies is due to the fact that, in the order of charity, atonement to God was sought above any atonement due to man, and the spiritual welfare of citizens above their physical well-being.\nModern secularized society assumes that physical extinction is the worst thing that can happen to a human being, whereas the faith teaches that eternal damnation is incalculably worse.\nIn the context of the faith, the importance of a man’s present short life on earth cannot be compared with his future endless existence in heaven.\n+++\nAs we have seen, the death penalty has a very long history.\nDating from its institution by God in Eden to its delegation after the Flood to men who would wield it in God’s name, it has threaded its way without interruption through the fabric of human civilizations until these latter days.\nOne might expect that after the Incarnation, when God became man and replaced the Old Testament’s law of talion based on strict justice with a new dispensation based on love and grace, the death penalty could be safely abolished as outmoded.\nConverts to the prevailing conciliar religion and its “New Pentecost” would in fact argue in this wise, perhaps citing the Council’s famous declaration in Gaudium et Spes that, “Thanks to the experience of past ages ...the nature of man himself is more clearly revealed and new roads to truth are opened,” and the world now has “a keener awareness of human dignity” ( 44, 73).\n\nFar from obliterating the death penalty, however, the Incarnation only laid bare its deepest significance, hidden from the beginning.\nAs the new dispensation’s foremost theologian, St. Paul would declare, the old penalty remained very much in force: “Almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and without the shedding of blood there is no remission.” It is still “appointed for men once to die, and after this the judgment” (Heb.\n9: 22,27), but now with the possibility of eternal bliss in heaven.\nThis possibility is owed, furthermore, to a death by one of the cruelest means ever devised, unjustly inflicted on one supremely innocent Man who was God, in a miscarriage of human justice beyond any the world could ever have imagined.\nWhen God set the death penalty in Eden He pronounced it on Himself, to be carried out in the fullness of time through the malicious free wills of his own creatures.\nThe Cross which was its instrument is the very sign of Christianity, the only means of salvation.\n\nNot even from the Cross did Christ decry the death penalty, either for himself or for the two thieves crucified with Him.\nIt would continue to be dealt out to men by other men on earth, with only one significant change: Henceforth it would be administered under the authority of the glorified man who is Christ the King, as part and parcel of that universal power “in heaven and on earth” which He received from His Father (Matt.\n28:18) after His Resurrection.\nFrom that point on it is Christ who delegates the divine authority to punish by killing, and both Scripture and tradition testify that it is lawfully wielded by those to whom He entrusts the temporal sword in His Kingdom.\nAs He told Pontius Pilate at the time of His trial, “Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above” (John 19:10).\n\nPope Leo XIII re-affirmed this truth in Sapientiae Christianae in 1890, when he declared that “true and legitimate authority is devoid of sanction unless it proceed from God the supreme Ruler and Lord of all.\nThe Almighty alone can commit power to a man over his fellow men.” Even though they may be unaware of the true source of their power, it is always the duty of legitimate authorities to ensure public order by punishing evil-doers, by death if appropriate.\nAs St. Paul said:\nTherefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist purchase to themselves eternal damnation.\nFor rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil.\n.\n.\nFor he is the minister of God to thee for good.\nBut if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain.\nFor he is the minister of God: and avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil (Rom.\n13:2-4).\nSufficient of itself to expiate every sin which the children of Adam could ever commit, the execution of the Man-God nevertheless did not abolish the penalty of death.\nIt continues to be the wages of sin (Rom 6:23), and men must still submit to it sooner or later by forfeiting their lives, either willingly or unwillingly.\nA share in making restitution for sin was thus accorded to all of us, for although our Lord’s ignominious death removed from us the guilt of the original transgression through Baptism, it did not remove its effects.\nThese were allowed to remain as restraints on men who, now raised to a new supernatural existence, were capable of committing incalculably more grievous sins than heretofore.\nAs for the death penalty, it remains the inescapable consequence of our fallen nature and is of the highest utility in deterring us from following our hereditary inclination to evil.\n\nWhat Christ did was to sanctify the death penalty, transforming it into a sacrament of life for those who believe.\nAs St. Paul declared, “Death is swallowed up in victory.\nO death, where is thy victory?\nO death, where is thy sting?.\n.\n.\nFor by a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of the dead.\nAnd as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive” (1 Cor.\n15: 54-55; 21-22).\nThe first of that numberless host of Christian martyrs who would be put to death by constituted authority for testifying to the truth, Christ commanded His disciples to “Follow me!” Inviting all to Calvary to “suffer under Pontius Pilate” with Him, He granted a meritorious share in accomplishing “the mystery which hath been hidden for ages and generations, but is now made manifest to his saints” to all who, like St. Paul, would “now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up those things which are wanting of the sufferings of Christ in my flesh, for his body which is the church.\n.\n.” (Col. 1:26, 24).\n\nCriminals put to death undergo a penalty no different from the one exacted from the most innocent amongst us.\nAs with everyone else the moment of death ushers them either into heaven, hell or purgatory.\nThe most that can be said is that their lives here on earth are shortened, and they must settle their accounts sooner than expected.\nThis could be a great mercy for them as well as for society, both in terms of expiation and protection from any future crimes they might have perpetrated.\nThe death penalty, from the first one imposed on man by God in the beginning in Eden, to the one imposed on God by man on that Good Friday in Jerusalem, on down to those still being imposed today, transcends human legislation.\nBy divine decree it will perdure until the end of time, when “the former things are passed away.” Only then “death shall be no more, nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall be any more,” and not one minute sooner.\n(Apo.\n21:4).\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"America's Immigration Voice.\n\nKritarch Patti Saris, who thinks it is the job of District Court judges to micromanage the deportation system of the United States, got her wish.\nOne of the Indonesian illegal aliens benefiting from her little amnesty took the hint and used the opportunity that Saris created to flee from arrest and deportation, absconding to a sanctuary church to hide from arrest.\nKritarch Patti Saris\nSaris like many other Federal judges does not like our current immigration system and wants another system more to her liking.\nOne of those likings is an unlimited number of hearings as to previously denied asylum claims.\nCarrying his 3-year-old daughter in his arms, Yohanes Tasik scoped out the church classroom he indefinitely would call home.\nThe Indonesian Christian, facing mounting pressure to report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, took refuge Friday night inside the Reformed Church of Highland Park.\nHe is the third Indonesian Christian who claimed sanctuary within the church in fear of deportation.\n[Indonesian Immigrant Finds Sanctuary In N.J. Church, by Steph Solis, USA Today, January 16, 2018]\nSaris should know that when the appeal of her decision that the Indonesian illegal aliens gets reviewed by the Supreme Court, her decision will be struck down.\nSo she seem to have acted to encourage the illegal aliens in the case she is managing to see the writing on the wall, and use her order prohibiting their arrest and deportation to flee the authorities.Even the illegal aliens know that minor kritarchs have no authority over deportations, especially those that have been fully adjudicated and any claim of asylum found to be without any basis so they are taking up other options to fight deportation, like fleeing and hiding.\nA federal judge on Wednesday signaled she may extend an order preventing the deportation of roughly 50 Indonesian Christians living illegally in New Hampshire, a process that immigration officials began after U.S. President Donald Trump took office.\nU.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston expressed concern the Indonesians could be deported before their administrative appeals were finished, given their claims they could face religious persecution in the world’s largest majority-Muslim nation.\n[U.S. Judge May Extend Freeze On Indonesian Immigrants' Deportation, by Nate Raymond, Reuters, January 17, 2018]\nFederal officials contend they have always had the authority to deport them at any time.\n“There’s no legal basis for them to ask for more time,” Vinita Andrapalliyal, a U.S. Justice Department lawyer, argued in court on Wednesday.\nFederal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts.\nOver the Justice Department’s objections, Saris last year ruled she had jurisdiction over the case.\nShe entered a temporary order blocking the Indonesians’ deportation until she could decide whether to impose a preliminary injunction.\nRonaldo Rauseo-Ricupero, a lawyer for the Indonesians, argued they should have 90 days to move to reopen their cases after receiving copies of their administrative case files and time to appeal any decision rejecting those motions.\n“We don’t want to put them on a ship back unless someone has had chance to look at if there’s a really bad situation for them,” Saris said.\n“That’s my concern.”\nAnd Kritarch Saris has not stopped.\nShe is moving forward with more orders to halt deportation of illegal aliens.Kritarch Saris just does not accept that the immigration courts found no basis for their claim of persecution, and there is no evidence that they would face persecution today.\nShe and other kritarchs have acted outside the law, something that the reporter surprisingly puts in the story.And the Treason Bar attorney demanded that Kritarch Saris create a whole new second immigration appeals system of unlimited delay for these illegal aliens.Kritarch Saris thinks that her feelings about a deportation are the same as the law.Well, that is not Kritarch Saris' concern.\nThe concern over persecution overseas is reviewed by the Executive Branch, and that decision was entered--there is no \"bad situation\" for her to be concerned about.\nAnd Saris is not the only kritarch that thinks they run immigration policy--Mark Goldsmith thinks he runs immigration policy as well.\nA federal judge in Michigan has ordered the government to give bond hearings in preparation for releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants from Iraq into the community, saying the Constitution protects them from indefinite detention in the U.S. U.S. District Judge Mark A Goldsmith, an Obama appointee, earlier had halted deportations for nearly 300 Iraqis, saying that although they had long been ordered removed, conditions on the ground in Iraq had changed and they deserved new hearings.\nHis latest ruling Tuesday evening goes further, certifying some of the Iraqis as a class-action lawsuit and saying most of them should be “allowed to return to their productive lives” while they wait for new hearings — meaning they must be released from detention unless the government can prove they are a major risk to public safety.\n[Judge Orders Potential Release Of Hundreds Of Illegals From Iraq, by Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, January 3, 2018]\nHe is ordering the release of hundreds of Iraqi illegal aliens and criminal aliens, all because he wants them to have another bite at the

immigration policies of President Trump.\nIllegal aliens get only one hearing and one set of appeals to deportation.\nThey don't get another new and illegal set of hearings and appeals just because

Democrats tried to squirrel these jihad spies out of the country.\nCongress must investigate and act.\n“Witness Said Awan Wiretapped Her, Then Bank Account She Controlled Was Drained,” by Luke Rosiak, Daily Caller News Foundation, May 21, 2018 (thanks to Todd):\nAfter former Democratic IT aide Imran Awan allegedly threatened his stepmother not to talk to police, her email account was accessed in suspicious ways and a lawyer for one of Awan’s brothers found out she emailed the FBI on specific dates and lashed out at her: “You’re a liar, aren’t you?” Days after that, a bank account the stepmother controlled was almost completely drained through a payment to Imran’s brother, Abid Awan, bank records show — but she said she is too afraid to press criminal charges because she claims he has threatened her.\nThe stepmother, Samina Gilani, also previously said Imran stole two laptops from her.\nImran, Abid and Jamal Awan — along with Imran’s wife, Hina Alvi, and a friend — worked as IT administrators for 1 out of every 5 House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until police banned them from the network in February 2017for “numerous violations of House security policies.” Months later, none of the family is in jail, and the stepmother and other witnesses have said Imran and Abid have used their freedom to try to steer the outcome of the case since, including by threatening them not to cooperate with authorities, TheDCNF previously reported.\nIn April 2016, the House’s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) detected allegedly falsified purchase orders, and the Inspector General quickly expanded the scope to investigate cyber violations, finding that members of the Awan family improperly accessed congressmen’s servers and the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times.\nThough House officials suspected that equipment was being stolen, the Capitol Police did not search their homes, The Daily Caller News Foundation learned, and did not ban them from the network until nearly a year later.\nIn the meantime, evidence appears to have been compromised: In December 2016, the CAO notified congressmen that the caucus server had physically disappeared.\nThough Abid played a prominent role in the late-2016 IG report, he has not been arrested, with congressmen saying a criminal investigation is ongoing.\nIn January 2017, in the days around his father’s death, Abid removed Gilani as the beneficiary of his father’s life insurance and replaced her with himself, which led to a lawsuit, TheDCNF previously reported.\nAbid’s attorney, Jim Bacon, used the life insurance lawsuit to force Gilani to sit for a sworn deposition Oct. 4, 2017 in which he told her to reveal what she told the FBI about the congressional criminal probe and tried to get her to find out details from investigators.\nIn one exchange, Bacon knew that she had emailed with the FBI.\nBACON Q: [redacted] is your email address, isn’t it?\nAnd you send emails from

{"prompt":"﻿Communion to Adulterers Promulgated as \"Authentic Magisterium\"\n\nLast week, Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS)—the Vatican's organ for promulgating the Official Acts of the Apostolic See—published Pope Francis' October 2016 letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires in which he praised their episcopal guidelines allowing divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion in some cases while living in a state of objective mortal sin.\nIf papal clarification was ever needed on the long-debated issue of the intended meaning of Amoris Laetitia chapter VIII, such clarification has now been provided for the Church at large.\nConcerning these guidelines that allow \"the possibility of access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist\" in \"complex circumstances\" where \"limitations that lessen the responsibility and guilt\" permit adulterous couples to continue in adultery, the pope said in his letter:\n\"The document is very good and completely explains the meaning of chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia.\nThere are no other interpretations.\"\nUntil now, the pope's letter to the Argentinian bishops had been considered a private letter with no binding force, whereas AAS has now elevated Pope Francis' letter to the official magisterial status of an \"Apostolic Letter,\" while including a special rescript as an addendum by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State.\nThe rescript declares that Pope Francis expressly intends both documents—the papal letter and the episcopal guidelines—to bear the character of his \"authentic Magisterium,\" and that the pope has personally ordered their publication in AAS and on the Vatican website.\nHence Amoris Laetitia VIII, which proposes that people living in adultery can be guiltless and thus be admitted to the sacraments of Confession and Communion when \"concrete circumstances\" make it difficult to renounce their adulterous state, is now declared \"magisterial\" by the Holy See.\nThe problem with this is that heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial, so that if it is, it not only has no binding force, but the faithful are obliged to resist and refute such a declaration.\nSt. Thomas Aquinas says in his Summa Theologiae: \"If the faith were endangered, a subject ought to rebuke his prelate [pope] even publicly.\"\nThe fact is that this latest promulgation is counter-magisterial, but the pope and his right-hand man now feel they have enough support from the dissenting left that enables them to come forward with it.\nCardinal Parolin's rescript on the papal and episcopal documents reads as follows:\nRescript \"from an Audience with His Holiness\"\nThe Supreme Pontiff decreed that the two preceding documents be promulgated through publication on the Vatican website and in Acta Apostolicae Sedis, as authentic Magisterium.\nFrom the Vatican Palace, on the day of June 5 in the year 2017\nPietro Card.\nParolin\nSecretary of State\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia defines a papal rescript as follows: \"Rescripts are responses of the pope or a Sacred Congregation, in writing, to queries or petitions of individuals.\nSome rescripts concern the granting of favors; others the administration of justice, e.g.\nthe interpretation of a law.\"\nIt appears then that Parolin's rescript constitutes a direct reply to the dubia of the Four Cardinals.\nPope Francis' praise of the episcopal guidelines clearly answers the cardinals' query concerning his intention in Amoris Laetitia VIII, so will Cardinals Brandmuller and Burke now proceed to issue the formal correction of it?\nAs reported in The Dictator Pope—a remarkable new book which provides an inside look at the most tyrannical and unprincipled papacy of recent history—English Cardinal Cormac Murphy O’Connor who was largely responsible for the vote canvassing behind Francis' election told journalist Paul Valley in 2013, \"Four years of Bergoglio would be enough to change things.\"\nEach day, we see new evidence that this might have been a gross understatement.\nWe shouldn't rule out the possibility that Francis may come forward one day and declare \"ex-cathedra\" that the interpretation of Amoris Laetitia VIII, as now taught by the Holy See, is promulgated as \"extraordinary magisterium.\"\nShould this happen, the Mystical Body would then be without its head.\nIn an interview with Catholic World Report (CWR) in December 2016, Cardinal Raymond Burke, who is presently a member of the Apostolic Signatura, said that if a pope were to \"formally profess heresy he would cease, by that act, to be the Pope.\"\nBurke was reiterating Church teaching, as expressed by famed canonist Franz Wernz in his Ius Canonicum: \"In sum, it needs to be said clearly that a [publicly] heretical Roman Pontiff loses his power upon the very fact.\"\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|3611|3673\nLoaded_Language|3943|3965\nLoaded_Language|4216|4264\nAppeal_to_Authority|919|1054."}

{"prompt":"Has Trump Opened the Door?\n\nSagacious gun owners have always known that the ultimate goal of gun control extremists such as Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein, et al., has always been gun confiscation.\nThe plan is not to “control” the private ownership of firearms; it is to PROHIBIT the private ownership of firearms.\nEnacting ever-encroaching gun control laws is simply an incremental means to the ultimate end of gun confiscation and prohibition.\nDonald Trump was elected on the promise of protecting the Second Amendment (among other things).\nInstead, he has become the poster boy for one of the most egregious gun control machinations of all: gun confiscation.\nAs I reported in this column last week, in a bipartisan meeting with congressmen and senators recently, President Trump “voiced support for confiscating guns from certain individuals deemed to be dangerous, even if it violates due process rights.\n“‘I like taking the guns early, like in this crazy man’s case that just took place in Florida … to go to court would have taken a long time,’ Trump said at a meeting with lawmakers on school safety and gun violence.\n“‘Take the guns first, go through due process second,’ Trump said.\n“Trump was responding to comments from Vice President Pence that families and local law enforcement should have more tools to report potentially dangerous individuals with weapons.\n“‘Allow due process so no one’s rights are trampled, but the ability to go to court, obtain an order and then collect not only the firearms but any weapons,’ Pence said.\n“‘Or, Mike, take the firearms first, and then go to court,’ Trump responded.”\nSee the column here:\nFlorida School Massacre Proves Police Are Worthless In Protecting Us\nWell, Trump’s statements are now the rallying cry for gun grabbers all over America to enact gun confiscation laws.\nSo far, five states have passed “red flag” laws that allow police agencies to confiscate guns from someone deemed to be “dangerous” by either a law enforcement officer or a family member BEFORE the individual has committed any crime, and in one State (Rhode Island) the governor issued an executive order implementing a “red flag” law.\nHere are the six states where the legislatures have already passed—or the governor has already issued an executive order implementing—“red flag” laws:\nCalifornia\nConnecticut\nIndiana\nOregon\nWashington\nRhode Island\nAnd since Trump’s Stalinist statements, there are at least 24 additional states that are currently considering passing “red flag” laws.\nThese are:\nAlabama\nAlaska\nArizona\nDelaware\nFlorida\nHawaii\nIllinois\nIowa\nKansas\nKentucky\nMaryland\nMassachusetts\nMichigan\nMinnesota\nMissouri\nNew Jersey\nNew York\nNorth Carolina\nOhio\nPennsylvania\nTennessee\nUtah\nVermont\nVirginia\nAnd it’s not taking long for law enforcement agencies in the above states to begin their Naziesque assault on gun owners.\nThis report is from Seattle:Doubtless, many other states are also considering passing “red flag” laws.\n“The city’s police department became the first law enforcement agency in the state to force the surrender of a firearm under a new law known as an ‘extreme risk protection order.’\n“The incident involves a man who lives in Belltown, who neighbors said had been intimidating people for the past year – even staring-down customers through store-front windows with a gun holstered at his side.\n“Mental illness is suspected, but that new law allowed police to legally disarm him.”\n“The man, who we are not naming, is also well known to the bars and restaurants below his unit along Second Ave.\nThe volume of complaints convinced Seattle police to seek an extreme risk protection order – or ‘erpo’ – which allows law enforcement to legally remove guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.\n“In this case, the man refused to comply.\nBecause of the new law, police were then able to return with a warrant and force the man to surrender the firearm.”\n“A few dozen erpos have been served and executed around the state, but Seattle police said they are the only agency so far to seize a gun because the owner refused to hand it over.\n“Law enforcement professionals said these specialized protection orders could be a common sense strategy to try and prevent mass shootings – such as what happened in Parkland, Florida.\n“‘There’s certainly a big concern of the connection between mental health and people exhibiting violent behavior and whether or not they should have access to firearms.\nThe “erpos” give us that tool now as an option,’ said Sgt.\nEric Pisconski, who leads the crisis response unit for the Seattle Police Department.\n“The confiscations only last a year, although they can be renewed.”\nSee the report here:\nSeattle Police First In State To Seize Gun Under Mental Health Law\nA few observations are in order here:\nFirst, the open carry of a firearm is LEGAL in the area where this took place.\nSo, the fellow was violating NO gun laws whatsoever.\nPlus, he never removed the pistol from its holster or brandished it in any way.\nSecondly, the man was “known” to nearby bars and restaurants near his place of residence.\nThat means nothing.\nKnown for what?\nThe report doesn’t even say the man was known for acting weirdly or strangely.\nIt just says he was “known.” And even if he did act weirdly or strangely, if we denied constitutional rights to everyone in that category, a majority of Americans would have no rights, and ALL of Congress would have no rights.\nThirdly, what does “volume of complaints” mean?\nHow many complaints were received over a YEAR’S time?\nTwo?\nFive?\nTen?\nPeople complaining about other people happens all of the time.\nPlus, if complaints had been received over the course of an entire year and police just now decided to act, the man must not have been considered much of a threat.\nFourthly, there was NO report of the man “exhibiting violent behavior,” as the police sergeant claims.\nThe report says “he had been intimidating people.” How?\nNo specifics except to say he was “staring” at people.\nWow!\nRun for your lives!\nFifthly, a U.S. citizen who has committed NO CRIME is denied his Natural right of self-defense for a whole year.\nAnd the media report says the confiscations “only” last a year, with the caveat that they may be extended.\nIndeed.\nThey could and very likely will be extended indefinitely.\nHow many defenseless (unarmed) people are robbed, assaulted, accosted, beaten up, raped, wounded, paralyzed, or killed in a year’s time?\nIt seems many politicians (and many police officers themselves) will not be content until every American citizen is totally defenseless and unable to protect him or herself.\nI tell you this with all seriousness: At some point, the American people will be forced to view these governmental attacks against our Second Amendment liberties as a declaration of war.\nSixthly, the man quoted in the news story who had complained about the armed fellow did so because he said he didn’t like the sight of the man carrying a firearm, as it made him “afraid.”\nSO WHAT?\nThat the mere sight of a law-abiding citizen openly carrying a sidearm would make someone “afraid” is not sufficient reason to deny the citizen his constitutional right to keep and “bear” arms.\nThis “I’m offended” or “his gun scares me” complaint is nothing but cover for little Nazis to try and deny another person their Natural, God-given liberty.\nBut under this new “red flag” law in Washington State, police are now able to confiscate a person’s firearm without the person committing ANY crime—or even threatening to commit a crime.\nEven when police forced the man to surrender his firearm, the man made no threatening gesture toward the officers.\nGun confiscation has started in America—and President Trump’s Stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later is the banner under which this is happening.\nWhen Trump promised to add “mental health” regulations to gun purchases and ownership, he opened Pandora’s Box.\nI go into the “mental health” trap in more detail in this column:\nTrump Set To Enact More Gun Control\n“Mental health” regulations for gun ownership is what extremist gun grabbers Schumer, Pelosi, Feinstein, et al., have been trying to accomplish for decades.\nNow, it is the “pro-gun” Republican President Donald Trump who is the one making it happen.\nKris Kobach is the Secretary of State of Kansas.\nHe is a former professor of constitutional law at UMKC Law School.\nHe wrote an excellent analysis of the constitutional violations of these “red flag” laws:\nThe seizure of guns without any hearing at all.\nThe laws all contain an “ex parte” provision that allows the state to temporarily seize a person’s guns without even notifying the gun owner or giving him a chance to be heard.\nThis is the quintessential denial of due process.\nThe Fourth Amendment makes clear that a person cannot be denied of liberty (to exercise one’s constitutional right to bear arms) without due process of law.\nThis confiscation is “temporary,” but it can easily lead to long-term or permanent confiscation.\nBased on the testimony of one unrelated person.\nThe confiscation order can be based on the testimony of only one person claiming that the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others.\nThe law deceptively says that it has to be the testimony of a “family member.” [Most of the “red flag” laws, such as the one in Washington State, do not limit who can claim the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others to family members.]\nBut “family member” is defined to include “former dating partners” and anyone who has ever lived with the defendant.\nSo a jilted former boyfriend or girlfriend, or even a roommate from years ago, could easily set in motion the disarming of a lawful gun owner.\nUsing a very low standard of proof.\nThe standard for obtaining an ex parte order against a gun owner is absurdly low – one need only show “reasonable cause” to believe that the person may pose a risk.\nThat’s even lower than the “probable cause” standard for obtaining a search warrant.\nIn addition, the judge is forced to rush his decision and issue the confiscation order on the same day of the ex parte hearing.\nWithin two weeks of the ex parte hearing, a hearing with the gun owner present must occur; the purpose is to put in place a long-term confiscation order.\nBut even at that hearing, the standard of proof is far below the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used in criminal trials.\nRather, it need only be shown by “a preponderance of evidence” that the person poses a risk of injury to self or others.\nWhat kind of evidence?\nThings like the “reckless storage” of firearms and drinking habits can be considered.\nIf you keep a handgun in the bedside table and drink beer regularly, you may [be] in trouble.\nShifting the burden of proof to the gun owner.\nThe long-term confiscation order lasts up to a year, but may be renewed indefinitely.\nOnce it is in place, it becomes very difficult to remove.\nTo have the confiscation order lifted, the gun owner must provehe does not pose a threat to himself or others.\nProving a negative is nearly impossible.\nAdding insult to injury, the bill even authorizes local law enforcement to charge the gun owner a storage fee for confiscating and storing his guns.\nAfter the Parkland school shooting, had Donald Trump simply used his bully pulpit to promote arming teachers and school employees as a deterrent and defense against these school shootings without calling for more gun control, it would have been a HUGE boost for the Second Amendment in general and school safety in particular.\nInstead, Trump fell in with anti-Second Amendment liberals and started calling for more gun control, adding “mental health” restrictions to gun purchases and making his stupid Stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later.\nAs a result, anti-gun liberals all over the country are using Trump’s own words and proposed gun control policies as a rallying cry to enact gun confiscation laws.\nAs it stands right now, Donald Trump has opened the door for more damage being done to the Second Amendment than any other president, Democrat or Republican, in our lifetime.\nFreedomists in the 50 states had better keep a close eye on their State legislatures this year and next, because, thanks to Donald Trump, gun confiscation is going to be on the agenda in virtually every single State in the country.\nAnd while you are at it, don’t overlook the federal Congress.\nNo wonder Dianne Feinstein looked so deliriously (and devilishly) happy when Trump uttered his stupid comment about gun confiscation and said he wanted to bring an assault weapons ban (Feinstein’s bill) into proposed gun control legislation.\nSee the video here:\nWatch Dianne Feinstein Erupt With Glee After Trump Seems To Endorse Her Assault Weapons Ban\nBut if you are a freedom-loving American who values your liberties and the God-given right to defend them, happy is NOT what you should be feeling right now.\nYou should be OUTRAGED at Donald Trump, and you should be absolutely determined to be ever vigilant against ANY attempt from Democrats or Republicans from federal, State, or municipal government to enact further restrictions against your right to keep and bear arms—because Trump has opened the door not only for more gun control but also for gun confiscation.\nP.S.\nOne more time I want to remind readers that self-defense—including defense against tyrannical government—is more than a right guaranteed in the Second Amendment to our Constitution; it is a duty assigned us in Nature by our Creator.\nFor anyone, especially a Christian, to willingly surrender their means of self-defense is not only a crime against liberty; it is a sin against God.\nI urge my Christian friends (and anyone else) to read the book my constitutional attorney son and I wrote entitled “To Keep or Not To Keep: Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns.”\nMark it down: Any law demanding the citizenry to surrender their AR-15 rifles would be unconstitutional, unnatural, and unbiblical.\nAnd NO Christian or other free man should ever comply with such a law.\nI know that there is a plethora of pastors who teach that Christians ought to obey the government should it outlaw our guns.\nTHEY ARE WRONG.\nThey are wrong biblically, constitutionally, and morally.\nOur book shows the Natural and Biblical duty of self-defense.\nI don’t know of another book like it.\nWith all that is happening today, it is CRUCIAL that people (especially Christians) become familiar with the truths contained in this book.\nI urge you to order one for yourself and one (at least) for your friends and kinfolk.\nReprinted with permission from Chuck Baldwin.\nThe Best of Chuck Baldwin\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"DRC: Fresh Ebola outbreak kills two in Equateur Province\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that it was taking steps to help deal with a new outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo's rural northwest, after two cases of the deadly virus were confirmed in the market town of Bikoro.\nCongo's Health Ministry said two of the five samples it sent to the National Institute of Biological Research in Kinshasa, came back positive for the disease.\nThe samples were gathered after health officials in Equateur Province notified Kinshasa on May 3 of about 21 cases of a hemorrhagic fever in the Ikoko Impenge area, including 17 deaths, according to WHO and Congo's government.\nWhat is Ebola?\nRare but deadly, the viral disease is most commonly affecting primates and humans.\nInitial symptoms can include fever, headache, joint and muscle aches, weakness, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pain lack of appetite and in some cases internal and external bleeding, according to WHO.\nWhere did it originate from?\nEbola virus disease (EVD) was first discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks.\nOne in what is now Nzara in South Sudan.\nThe other outbreak in Yambuku in Zaire in what is now DR Congo.\nThe latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.\nWhy is it so dangerous?\nThe average Ebola fatality rate is about 50 percent.\nBut the rates have varied from 25 percent to 90 percent in recent outbreaks.\nThere is as of yet no proven cure available for Ebola, though some vaccines are being tested.\nSome people who have recovered from Ebola have developed long-term complications, such as joint and vision problems.\nIt is not known why some people recover from Ebola while most succumb to the disease.\nWhy does it keep coming back?\nThe disease infects humans through close contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope.\nIn Africa where most outbreaks happen, particular species of fruit bats are considered natural hosts for the Ebola virus.\nInfected bats are believed to transmit the disease to humans, or indirectly through other animals that are hunted for their meat.\nThe family of the first victim of the 2014 outbreak, a two-year-old child, hunted bats and it is believed bushmeat was the origin of the outbreak.\nAn estimated five million tonnes of bushmeat is consumed on the continent every year, according to the Centre for International Forestry Research.\nThe virus then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments.\nEven funerals of Ebola victims can be a risk, if mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased.\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_fear-prejudice|2645|2735."}
{"prompt":"Hungarian Prime Minister Hits Nail On The Head: Refugees Are Actually \"Muslim Invaders\"\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban doesn't mince words when it comes to the Muslim invasion

– a common route for migrants heading for ‘wealthy’ Europe.\n“So, they are not running for their lives [in these countries].\nThey are merely economic migrants seeking a better life,” Orban concluded.\nHe stressed though, that he can only speak for the Hungarians and they “don’t want” immigration.\nIn his view, the government simply can’t go against the will of the people.\nAnd Orban has stayed the course, too while governments like that of Germany have ignored their people to allow for a clear invasion of Germany that has led to untold numbers of sexual assaults by Muslim migrants, attacks on Christians and there's no telling the amount of damage to the unethical welfare system in the country.\nRT continues:\nGoing further, the prime minister noted that no refugee wants to go to Portugal, for example, adding that the majority of asylum seekers simply wanted to live in prosperous Germany.\n“The reason why people are in your country is not because they are refugees, but because they want a German life,” he said, describing the issue “politically” as a European problem but, “sociologically,” as a German problem.\nOrban specifically targeted Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ‘open-door’ policy towards asylum seekers.\n“I’ve never understood how chaos, anarchy and illegal border crossings are viewed as something good in a country like Germany, which we view as the best example of discipline and the rule of law,” he said.\nThe recent wave of refugees reaching Europe is merely an invasion, according to Orban.\n“If someone wants to come to your house, he knocks on your door and asks: ‘Can we come in, can we stay?’ They [asylum seekers] didn’t do that, they crossed the border illegally,” he stated.\nOrban then did what most political representatives will simply not do, he told the truth about multiculturalism.\nHe called it an \"illusion\" and said that Christian and Muslim societies “will never unite.”\nOf course, they won't.\nThey have absolutely nothing in common.\nThey cannot agree on God's law, which most Western societies were base on, including the united States.\nThey cannot agree on the Scriptures.\nThey cannot agree on the person and work of Jesus the Christ.\nThey can't even agree on the means of proselytizing and of what real spiritual weapons are.\nPM Orban has remained consistent.\nHe has publicly told the Muslim invaders to leave Hungary and never come back.\nHe has rebuffed Brussels, which is largely Islamic, and told them that Hungary would defend its borders, and it has.\nOrban's border wall reduced illegal immigration by 99%!\nHe has genuinely reached out his hand to help Christian migrants instead of Muslim migrants and he seems to be one that holds to the Christian faith, as emulated by the Protestant Reformers, saying, \"That which serves the glory of God is the best for the people.\"\nFurthermore, Orban has also called out the man behind the curtain in a lot of the promoting of this Muslim invasion of the West, George Soros.\nAnti-jihadist activist Pamela Geller praised Orban for his honesty and wrote, \"At last, a politician who speaks the truth about the Muslim invasion of Europe.\nAnd while Orban is right that these are 'economic migrants,' they are also 'Muslim invaders.'\"\n\"They don’t want a 'German life' in Germany in the sense that they are willing to accept German values,\" she added.\n\"Many, all too many, of them want to overwhelm German values, and European values in general, with sharia values.\nThey are in Europe to conquer and Islamize it, with willing and eager help from Europe’s short-sighted, self-serving, internationalist intelligentsia.\"\nIndeed!\nThank you Prime Minister Orban for saying what needed to be said!\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"The JFK Cover-Up Continues\n\nWhile the mainstream media was announcing for the past two weeks that President Trump was going to release the CIA’s long-secret records on the JFK assassination, I took a different position.\nOn Monday of this week, I predicted that Trump would make a deal with the CIA that would enable the CIA to continue its cover-up of the JFK assassination.\n(See “I Predict Trump Will Continue the CIA’s JFK Assassination Cover-Up” and “No Smoking Guns in the JFK Records?”)\nOn Thursday, the day of the deadline established by law for releasing the records, Trump granted the CIA’s request for continued secrecy, on grounds of “national security,” more than 50 years after the Kennedy assassination.\nPlease, don’t start calling me Nostradamus.\nA blind man could see what was happening.\nDonald “Art of the Deal” Trump was obviously negotiating all week with the CIA, and he was obviously pushing to get what he wanted all the way up to the very last day.\nOn Thursday, the deadline established by law for releasing the records, the CIA undoubtedly blinked and Trump presumably got what he wanted in return for granting the CIA request for continued secrecy.\nTime to buy old US gold coins\nSome mainstream media commentators are criticizing the CIA for waiting until the very last day to make its case for continued secrecy.\nDisplaying their naivete, they demonstrate their lack of understanding about how things work in Washington, D.C. As I indicated in my Monday article, when someone in the federal government needs a favor from someone else, the someone else is going to ask for something in return.\nJFKu2019s War with the... Douglas Horne Check Amazon for Pricing.\nThe fact is that the CIA put in its request to Trump for continued secrecy of its JFK records long before yesterday.\nBut “Art of the Deal” Trump obviously sat on the request, undoubtedly hoping that he could get what he wanted in return if he just continued holding out and conveying that he was ready to release the records.\nDon’t forget: According to Trump’s own tweets, he had already ostensibly decided to deny the CIA’s request for secrecy before the Thursday deadline:\nTrump tweet sent on Saturday, October 21: “Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.” Trump tweet sent on Wednesday, October 25: “The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow.\nSo interesting!\nNow, it’s theoretically possible that the CIA presented Trump with some earthshattering new information on the Thursday deadline that showed that the United States would fall into the ocean if Americans were finally permitted to see the CIA’s long-secret JFK records.\nBut how likely is that?\nNot likely at all!\nInstead, it is a virtual certainly that when Art of the Deal Trump sent out those two tweets, he was sending a message to the CIA as part of the negotiations: Give me what I want or I will release the records.\nIn the negotiations, both Trump and the CIA knew that Trump was in the catbird seat.\nThe Kennedy Autopsy Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\nIn the end, the CIA blinked, just as Trump knew it would.\nContrary to what the mainstream press is asserting, the records undoubtedly contain more incriminating circumstantial evidence that fills in the mosaic of a U.S. national-security regime-change operation on November 22, 1963.\nThat’s what the mainstream media, forever wedded to the official story no matter how ridiculous and illogical it is, simply cannot bring themselves to confront.\nTrump knew that he had the CIA over a barrel.\nAs I indicated in my two articles this week, the CIA was between a rock and a hard place.\nOn the one hand, it could refuse to grant Trump what he wanted and let the records be released, which it knew would point to the CIA’s guilt in the assassination.\nOn the other hand, it could give Trump what he wanted and have to suffer the obvious inference that people would draw — that the CIA was continuing to cover up incriminatory evidence.\nWhat did the CIA give Trump in return for Trump’s extending the CIA’s 50-year-plus secrecy?\nWe don’t know, but my hunch is that it pertains to Russia.\nHere’s my next prediction: the congressional investigations into Trump’s supposed “collusion” with Russia are about to fizzle out.\nThat’s because I believe that the CIA, as part of its deal with Trump, will order its assets in Congress to cease and desist with respect to that investigation.\nIn my opinion, that’s the price the CIA had to pay in return for its continued cover-up of its U.S. regime-change operation in November 1963.\nNotice something else about the deal that Trump has presumably made with the CIA: The secrecy arrangement extends only to April.\nOstensibly, the next six months are needed to carefully review the records to determine whether the records really to relate to “national security.” Regime Change: The JFK... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\nNot surprisingly, the mainstream media isn’t even questioning that ludicrous notion.\nFor more than 50 years, the CIA has known why it has wanted those particular records to be kept secret.\nDuring the term of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s, the CIA decided to keep these particular records secret for another 25 years.\nThere are bound to be lots of CIA memoranda detailing why it was imperative to keep these particular records secret for as long as possible.\nFinally, the CIA made its request for secrecy to Trump at least several weeks ago.\nThe notion that the CIA suddenly hit Trump yesterday with a new argument as to why “national security” would be threatened, after Trump had supposedly already rejected the arguments that had been presented to him, causing Trump to suddenly change his mind, is, well, laughable.\nSo, why the April deadline?\nWhy not extend the secrecy for another 25 years, which is undoubtedly what the CIA wanted?\nBecause Trump obviously needed collateral to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the deal.\nIf Trump had extended the secrecy for 25 years, he would have lost leverage to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the bargain.\nLet’s say, hypothetically, that I’m right: that the CIA agreed to use its assets in Congress to shut down the Russia investigation.\nTo make certain that the CIA fulfills its part of the bargain, Trump would need the April deadline so that the threat of the records release would continue hanging over the CIA.\nIf the CIA fails to fulfill its part of the bargain, Trump releases the records in April.\nIf the CIA squelches the Russia investigations, Trump grants another extension of time in April.\nLet’s state the obvious: The CIA records that are still being suppressed have nothing to do with “national security.” They have everything to do with covering up the CIA’s role in the U.S. national-security regime-change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963, which succeeded in ousting from power a president who was, in the eyes of the U.S. national-security establishment, engaged in actions The CIA, Terrorism, an...

Jefferson Morley Check Amazon for Pricing.\nAfter Oswald supposedly tried to defect to the Soviet Union and promised U.S. Embassy officials in Moscow that he was going to deliver classified information to the Soviet Union, which was America’s sworn Cold War enemy (and former World War II partner and ally), U.S. officials permitted him to return home with a Red wife, without even one grand-jury summons or even an iota of harassment.\nThink about Martin Luther King, John Walker Lindh, Edward Snowden, the U.S. Communist Party, or the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.\nThink about how the U.S. national-security establishment treats what it suspects are communists or traitors.\nIt skewers them.\nWhy, just look at how they call Julian Assange a traitor and he isn’t even an American.\nRecall the McCarthy hearings.\nDalton Trumbo.\nThe entire U.S. anti-communist crusade, including Vietnam, which more than 58,000 U.S. soldiers died killing communists.\nAnd they’re going to tell us that they just let Lee Harvey Oswald, a supposed self-avowed communist skate blissfully across the Cold War stage of history with nary any abuse or harassment at all?\nDon’t make me laugh.\nSoon after the Warren Commission was established, Warren called a super-secret meeting of the commission to address information that had come into Warren’s possession.\nThat information was that Oswald was actually working for U.S. intelligence.\nYes, a spy, the type of people that work for the CIA.\nThat would make sense, especially given that the Marine Corps is a prime recruiting place for the CIA.\nSemper fidelis!\nNow, suddenly, all the circumstantial evidence in the Kennedy assassination falls into place.\nIt begins to make sense.\nThe mosaic starts to be filled out: They needed to get rid of Kennedy to protect national security and elevate Johnson, who had the same anti-communist mindset as the Pentagon and the CIA, to the presidency.\nUnlike JFK, who had begun withdrawing troops from Vietnam, Johnson would The Man Who Killed Ken...

from the day after the 2016 presidential election reveals the company tried to influence the 2016 United States presidential election on behalf of one candidate, Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nIn the emails, a Google executive describes efforts to pay for free rides for a certain sect of the population to the polls–a get-out-the-vote for Hispanic voters operation–and how these efforts were because she thought it would help Hillary Clinton win the general election in 2016.\nShe also used the term “silent donation” to describe Google’s contribution to the effort to elect Clinton president.\nThe main email, headlined, “Election results and the Latino vote,” was sent on Nov. 9, 2016—the day after Clinton’s loss to Trump in the 2016 presidential election—by Eliana Murillo, Google’s Multicultural Marketing department head.\nThe four page email begins with Murillo claiming she and others at Google were engaged in non-partisan activities not designed to help any one candidate or another—only to undercut her own commentary in later passages in the emails by openly admitting the entire effort to boost Latino turnout using Google products with official company resources was to elect Clinton over Trump.\nThe critical miscalculation, Murillo wrote in a stunning admission in the email, was that Latino voters backed Trump by higher margins than any experts had forecast in the lead-up to the election.\nTrump’s 29 percent among Hispanics nationally blew prognosticators away, and he hit even higher numbers—about 31 percent—in the key battleground state of Florida, Murillo admitted.\nMurillo wrote at the outset of the lengthy message:\nWe worked very hard.\nMany people did.\nWe pushed tp get out the Latino vote with our features, our partners, and our voices.\nWe kept our Google efforts non-partisan and followed our company’s protocols for the elections strategy.\nWe emphasized our mission to give Latinos access to information so that they can make an informed decision at the polls, and we feel very grateful for all the support to do this important work.\nLatinos voted in record-breaking numbers, particularly with early votes.\nA large percentage of Latino voters in Florida were new voters who had become citizens just in time to vote.\nWe saw high traffic for the search queries ‘votar,’ ‘como votar,’ and ‘donde voter,’ in key states like Florida and Nevada.\nWe will be pulling in more info in the coming hours\/days but so far we definitely know there was high traffic on search in Spanish.\nWithout translating our tools the users wouldn’t have found the information they needed.\nObjectively speaking, our goal was met — we pushed and successfully launched the search features in Spanish, and we thank Lisa for her support in advocating for this work.\nI sent Philipp a note yesterday to thank him because he and others voiced their support for this too, and we greatly appreciate it.\nEven Sundar gave the effort a shout out and a comment in Spanish, which was really special.\n“Sundar” presumably refers to Google’s chief executive officer Sundar Pichai, who took the reins of the massive search giant in October 2015.\n“Lisa” presumably refers to Lisa Gevelber, the vice president of Global Marketing for Google—who forwarded Murillo’s entire four-page email to several other Google executives in another chain also obtained by Breitbart News in which Gevelber praises Murillo’s activities with official company resources as having made a “great difference.” “Philipp” presumably refers to Philipp Schindler, a senior vice president and Google’s chief business officer per his LinkedIn page.\nThe emails were first revealed on Fox News on Monday evening on Tucker Carlson Tonight by anchor Tucker Carlson in a special report.\nBreitbart News also obtained them, and has reached out to Google with a number of questions about the emails.\nCarlson, in his exclusive report on Fox News Monday night, compared the revelations in the Google emails to the probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election to Special Counsel Robert Mueller—raising the question about how much influence tech giants like Google and Facebook have on election outcomes in the United States.\nCarlson cited Dr. Robert Epstein, a social scientist and an expert on Google, who has said, in Carlson’s words, “Google alone could determine the outcome of almost any election just by altering its search selections and we would never know it.”\nEpstein has published research detailing how Google could influence the results of U.S. elections.\nBreitbart News has exclusively published several of Epstein’s reports, including a recent one showing that Google search manipulation can swing huge swaths of voters.\nIn his report on Monday night, Carlson then described the emails he obtained, which Breitbart News also obtained.\nCarlson said:\nThis wasn’t a get-out-the-vote effort or whatever they say.\nIt wasn’t aimed at all potential voters.\nIt wasn’t even aimed at a balanced cross-section of subgroups.\nGoogle didn’t try to get out the vote among say Christian Arabs in Michigan or say Persian Jews in Los Angeles—they sometimes vote Republican.\nIt was aimed only at one group, a group that Google cynically assumed would vote exclusively for the Democratic Party.\nFurthermore, this mobilization effort targeted not only the entire country but swing states vital to the Hillary campaign.\nThis was not an exercise in civics, this was political consulting.\nIt was in effect an in-kind contribution to the Hillary Clinton campaign.”\nCarlson noted that in communication with Google, the company “did not deny that the email was real or that it showed a clear political preference.”\n“Their only defense was that the activities they described were either non-partisan or were not officially taken by the company,” Carlson said Monday night, describing Google’s official response to his requests for comment, before challenging the company’s response: “But of course they were both.\nPlenty of people in Google knew what was going on and we haven’t seen any evidence anyone at Google disapproved of it and tried to rein it in.”\nThe email from Murillo continues by explaining just how expansive the efforts the company undertook to achieve its objective were:\nWe had our partners help spread the word about our features on social media, including YouTubers and influencers like Dulce Candy, Jorge Narvaez, Jessie y Joy, Barbara Bermudo, and Pamela Silva of Univision, Jackie Cruz aka La Flaca from Orange is the New Black, and more.\nWe promoted our partner the Latino Community Foundation’s non-partisan #YoVoyaVotaryTu (I’m going to vote, are you?)\ncampaign and leveraged our social media influencer friends’ reach to hit over 11M impressions with that hashtag.\nWe hosted an event with over 200 people and a hangout with social media influencers about the power of the Latino vote and the new research Nielsen published about the Latino electorate.\nThis reached 4.4M social media impressions and signaled to many that Google and our partners value the Latino community and our role in this election.\nWe brought the same research to the LATISM conference, where people were beyond thrilled to see Google’s support and acknowledgment of the Latino community.\nIf Murillo had ended her email there, this probably would not amount to the level of a national news story.\nBut she did not: She went on for another several paragraphs on the first page and an extra three pages to admit the openly partisan intent of Google’s actions, including a remarkable in-writing confirmation that at least one of Google’s actions amounted to a “silent donation”—something that could raise Federal Election Commission (FEC) red flags if authorities decide to launch an official investigation into this matter, now that these emails have been publicly revealed.\nIt is in the next paragraph that Murillo openly admits that Google made a “silent donation,” in her words, paying for rides to polls via leftist organization Voto Latino.\nMurillo wrote in the next paragraph:\nWe also supported partners like Voto Latino to pay for rides to the polls in key states (silent donation).\nWe even helped them create ad campaigns to promote the rides (with support from HOLA folks who rallied and volunteered their time to help).\nWe supported Voto Latino to help them land an interview with Senator Meza of Arizona (key state for us) to talk about the election and how to use Google search to find information about how to vote.\nThey were a strong partner, among many in this effort.\nThe next paragraph is where Murillo begins to make her next major admission: that the effort was not just to increase voter turnout generally but to elect Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.\n“Ultimately, after all was said and done, the Latino community did come out to vote, and completely surprised us,” Murillo wrote.\n“We never anticipated that 29% of Latinos would vote for Trump.\nNo one did.\nWe saw headlines like this about early voter turn out and thought that this was finally the year that the ‘sleeping giant’ had awoken.”\nOn the next page, the email continues with a headline from an article in The Atlantic by James Fallows: “2016: The Year Latinos Saved America?”\nUnder that was a tweet from Jon Ralston of Ralston Reports in Nevada saying, among other things, that “Trump is dead” because of Latino turnout in early voting in the state.\nTrump did not end up winning Nevada in the end, but he did beat Clinton in 30 and a half other states.\n…\nAt that point, after the Ralston tweet, Murillo openly admits the partisan motives of Google’s electioneering efforts.\n“On personal note, we really thought we had shown up to demonstrate our political power against a candidate who had vehemently offended our community by calling us rapists and drug dealers,” Murillo wrote.\n“We read the headline and thought WOW, we did it!”\nMurillo’s email continues by including another headline, this time from the New Yorker’s Benjamin Wallace-Wells: “Latino Voters Show Trump What It Means to Be American.” That piece was written on Nov. 7, 2016, the day before the election.\nThen she begins writing again: “But then reality set in.\nOnly 71% of Latinos voted for Hillary, and that wasn’t enough.”\nThe third page of the email begins with another headline and image of a Latina woman in a red Make America Great Again hat and “Latinos for Trump” sign.\nThe story, from Ruben Navarette, Jr., published in the Daily Beast, is headlined: “Why the Latino Vote Didn’t Save America.” The sub-headline, “Hispanic voters were supposed to be one of Clinton’s blue firewalls—but one in three ended up splitting for Trump,” is also included in Murillo’s Google email.\nFrom there, Murillo continues writing for another page and a half:\nThe voters we wanted to reach did end up having an influence in the end, most notably in Florida.\nLatino voters voted for Trump more in Florida than in other states (31%), and FL was critical by popular vote and the electoral college.\nWe’ll keep an eye on any other results that can show us the influence that our efforts had on the election.\nWe know we gave this our best and are now figuring out what comes next.\nThanks again for all your help and support in this effort.\nIn the next paragraph, Murillo again openly admits she was not “objective” when it came to the election.\n“I have tried to stay objective, but I ask that you please give us some time to pause and reflect,” Murillo wrote.\n“This is devastating for our Democratic Latino community.\nAfter all these efforts and what we thought was positive momentum toward change, the results are not what we expected at all.\nWe are afraid for our families, and especially for the millions of immigrants who now don’t know what the future holds for them.”\nAfter that, Murillo says she cannot communicate with key organizers of the effort by Google and its partners—a project known as HOLA—because she is afraid of secret pro-Trump spies on the listservs created.\nShe also admits ongoing discussions among these people about meeting to give grieving Hillary Clinton supporters hugs after Trump crushed her on election day.\nShe also says those involved in Google’s get-out-the-vote efforts were openly seeking consolation after Clinton lost, and that she and another person cried after Trump won – for the first time they have cried due to an election result.\nMurillo wrote:\nWhat’s most difficult for us is we can’t even email the HOLA list to reach our community and discuss what this means for us because we know that apparently some may actually be Trump supporters.\nThere is a thread right now among the core HOLA group where people are sharing how much they hurt, how much they need support right now, and that they are coordinating in different offices to meet up to just hold each other.\nOne in a remote office said ‘If you guys do any sort of meetings, I’d love to join virtually.\nI think I’m currently the only Latinx in my office.\nIt’s kinda hard.’ #understatement.\nAnother said, ‘I’ve never cried after an election until last night.’ Same here.\nShe was not done there.\nIn the next paragraph, Murillo wrote that this election result hurt her badly.\nShe also admits the election result was a “loss,” another indication that Google’s efforts were clearly attempting to use company resources to elect Democrat Clinton over Republican Trump and influence the results of the election.\nShe also says that the company—and herself in particular—will redouble efforts in the future to get a different and more desired result in future elections.\n“I’m in shock and it hurts more than I could have ever imagined, but trying to stay optimistic and keep my head high,” Murillo wrote.\n“Loss is a part of life, and I do think frustrations challenge us to work smarter and get creative.\nMy partners have sent notes and are saying the same thing — time to keep working harder.”\nAt the top of the fourth page of the email, Murillo asks her colleagues at Google to give out a “smile” to grieving leftist Latinos who work at the company.\n“If you see a Latino Googler in the office (California\/New York), please give them a smile,” Murillo wrote.\n“They are probably hurting right now.\nIt’s tough to handle now that we know not all of us were against this, so we may be even more divided than ever.\nAt least in CA\/NY though, you can rest assured that the Latinos of these blue states need your thoughts and prayers, at least for them and their families.”\nThen, she continues by stating she is going on a planned vacation she thought she was taking to “celebrate” a Clinton win, but after Trump won, she says, her vacation “will be time to reflect on how to continue to support my community through these difficult times.”\nMurillo, in the next line, reveals that she thought she was sharing her viewpoints on these matters in a tight circle that would not leak.\n“I’m not sharing my personal opinions very broadly, but wanted to share openly here in the circle of trust,” she wrote.\nThis email leaked to Fox News and Breitbart News and is now likely to become a centerpiece in the case that Google is throwing its weight around to interfere in elections in the United States in a partisan manner against the duly elected President of the United States.\nThis email from Murillo was not just from some rogue staffer inside Google.\nHer original email was forwarded on to other Google executives by the aforementioned Gevelber, according to another email obtained by Breitbart News.\n“Thought you all would want to read this,” Gevelber wrote in her own message endorsing Murillo’s email in a message to other Google bigwigs.\n“It’s from Eliana Murillo who runs US Hispanic Marketing on my team and who helped found HOLA our Hispanic ERC.”\nGevelber continued by commending everyone she said, “worked so hard to ensure all the Get out the Vote were done in Spanish” that their efforts “made a giant difference” in the election “to Googlers and beyond.”\nPresident Trump and Republicans have just begun scratching the surface of bias against them among Silicon Valley’s elite, including, perhaps foremost alongside Facebook, from Google.\nA source close to the White House who has reviewed these emails ahead of their public release told Breitbart News that in a just world this would amount to, at a minimum, a clear violation of campaign finance law governing in-kind contributions to campaigns and causes.\n…\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS OF TRUMP'S IRAN INITIATIVE\n\nOriginally published the Jerusalem Post.\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran.\n\nNo, in his speech decertifying Iran’s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn’t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism.\nTrump’s move was not operational.\nIt was directional.\n\nIn his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran.\nFor the first time since 2009, when Obama backed the murderous regime in Tehran, spurning the millions of Iranians who rose up in the Green Revolution, Trump opened up the possibility that the US may begin to base its policies toward Iran on reality.\n\nTrump began his remarks by setting out Iran’s long rap sheet of aggression against America.\n\nStarting with the US embassy seizure and hostage crisis, Trump described Iran’s crimes and acts of war against America in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did.\n\nTrump’s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime’s repression of its own people.\n\nBy merging Iran’s external aggression with its internal repression, Trump signaled a readiness to drive a wedge – or expand the wedge – between the authoritarian theocrats that rule Iran and the largely secular, multiethnic and pro-Western people of Iran.\n\nTrump then turned his attention to Iran’s illicit ballistic missile program, its sponsorship of terrorism, including its links to al-Qaida, its aggression against its neighbors, its aggressive acts against maritime traffic in the Straits of Hormuz, and its bids to destabilize and control large swaths of the Middle East through its proxies.\n\nIt is notable that these remarks preceded Trump’s discussion of the nuclear deal – which was the ostensible subject of his speech.\nBefore Trump discussed Iran’s breaches of the nuclear deal, he first demonstrated that contrary to the expressed views of his top advisers, it is impossible to limit a realistic discussion of the threat Iran constitutes to US national security and interests to whether or not and it what manner it is breaching the nuclear accord.\n\nThis was a critical point because for the past two years, US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama’s nuclear pact.\nBy placing the nuclear deal in the context of Iran’s consistent, overarching hostility and aggression, Trump made it self-evident that no US interest is served in continuing to give Iran a free pass from congressional sanctions.\n\nAfter accomplishing that goal, Trump turned his attention to how Iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact.\nOnly then, almost as an afterthought, did he announce that he was decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, setting the conditions for the renewal of congressional sanctions on Iran and opening the floodgates of congressional sanctions on Iran in retaliation for the full spectrum of its aggressive and illicit acts against the US, its interests and allies.\n\nBy empowering Congress to prohibit economic cooperation with Iran, Trump put the Europeans, Chinese and Russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran.\n\nAfter putting them on notice, Trump discussed the possibility of improving Obama’s nuclear accord.\nAmong other things, he suggested expanding the inspection regime against Iran’s nuclear installations and canceling the so-called “sunset” clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of Iran’s nuclear advancement.\n\nTrump’s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major, positive shift in US policy toward Iran.\nSuch a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of Trump’s goals of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies.\n\nUnfortunately, it is also likely, indeed, it is more likely, that his words will not be translated into policies to achieve these critical aims.\n\nTrump’s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to Congress for holding Iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move.\nHe has a lot of enemies, and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on Capitol Hill.\n\nObama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, hadn’t agreed to cast the Constitution aside and ignore Obama’s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.\n\nOver the past week, Trump and Corker have been involved in an ugly public fight precipitated by Corker’s announcement that he will not be seeking reelection next year.\n\nToday Corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling Trump’s agenda.\nIf he wishes, out of spite, Corker can block effective sanctions from being passed.\nAnd he may do so even though the implications for his Senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nWhat is true for Corker is doubly true for the Democrats.\n\nLeading Democratic senators like Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin and Chuck Schumer, who opposed Obama’s Iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the Trump administration, they are required to oppose any change to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\n\nIndeed, given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give Iran a free pass for its anti-American aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House.\n\nThen again, by framing the issue of Iran’s threat to America as he did, and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on Iran to Congress, Trump opened up the possibility that Congress will conduct substantive – rather than personal – debates on Iran.\n\nAnd the more substantive those debates become, the further away the US discourse will move from the mendacious assumptions of Obama’s Iran policy – that the Iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential US ally, and that there is nothing inherently aggressive or problematic about Iran’s illicit nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe second major risk inherent in Trump’s approach is that he will get his way; that the Europeans, Russians and Chinese and the Iranians will agree to improve the nuclear deal.\nThe problem here is not obvious.\nClearly, it is better if the deal is amended to delete the sunset clauses and expand the inspections regime.\n\nYet even an amended, improved deal will still serve as a shield to Iran’s nuclear program.\nAn improved deal won’t destroy Iran’s centrifuges.\n\nIt won’t take away Iran’s enriched uranium.\nIt won’t destroy Iran’s nuclear installations.\nAnd it won’t bring down the regime which by its nature ensures all of these things will remain a menace to the US, its allies and international security as a whole.\n\nSo long as the US continues to maintain a policy based on the false view that all that is necessary to destroy the threat of a nuclear armed Iran is a combination of the nuclear deal and economic sanctions, it will continue to ensure that Iran and its nuclear program remain a major threat.\nDistressingly, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, the most outspoken supporter of decertifying Iranian compliance in the Trump administration, told NBC on Sunday that the US intends to remain in the nuclear deal.\n\nTo understand what must be done we must return to Trump’s speech and its strategic significance.\n\nBy taking a holistic view of the Iranian threat – grounded in a recognition of the inherent hostility of the regime – Trump opened up the possibility that the US and its allies can develop a holistic policy for confronting and defeating Iran and its proxies.\nIf the Iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy, they can be helpful.\n\nA wider strategy would target Iran’s regional aggression by weakening its proxies and clients from Hezbollah and Hamas to the regimes in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.\nIt would target the regime itself by empowering the ayatollahs’ domestic opponents.\nIt would pin down Iranian forces by arming and otherwise assisting the Iraqi Kurds to defend and maintain their control over their territory along the Iranian border while strengthening the ties between Iranian Kurds and Iraqi Kurds.\n\nFriday, Trump created the possibility for such a strategy.\nIt is up to

{"prompt":"Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence\n\nHomeschooling rates are skyrocketing as parents are continually getting more and more upset at the leftist social engineering taking place in public schools.\nThe indoctrination is getting so bad, that some parents are even concerned about liberal violence against those who reject the brainwashing.\nAccording to The Washington Times, the recent school shooting at Parkland, Florida, was the last straw for scores of parents.\nThe paper noted that “the phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven’t stopped yet.”\n“When the Parkland shooting happened, our phone calls and emails exploded,” said coalition president Tim Lambert.\n“In the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled.\nWe’re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month, and prior to that it was 600 to 700.” But according to Natural News, it isn’t just the rampant violence worrying some parents.\nThat’s just the tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg.\nChristopher Chin, head of Homeschool Louisiana, told The Times that parents are fed up with “the violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments.” Many parents are also disturbed by the social engineering, which amounts to brainwashing and indoctrination that goes on in a public school.\nFor example, a Minnesota public school is forcing Kindergarten students to study ‘white privilege’.\nThe left-wing curriculum and common core are also driving parents to remove their children from public schools.\nBrian D. Ray, who heads up the National Home Education Research Institute, in Salem, Oregon, who’s conducted homeschooling research for 33 years, told The Times that concern over school curriculum has reached the top of the charts for most parents.\nRay said the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment.\nSince teachers are not allowed to arm themselves to defend their students against the violence often perpetrated at schools simply because they are gun free zones, homeschooling takes care of that problem.\n“Most parents homeschool for more than one reason,” Ray told the paper.\n“But when we ask families why do they homeschool, near the top nowadays is concern about the environment of schools, and that includes safety, pressure to get into drugs, pressure to get into sexual activity.\nIt includes all of that.”\nIndoctrination means to teach a person to accept a belief uncritically.\nIt’s the very reason the governments of the world still exist.\nPeople cannot logically and critically understand that hurting people and taking their things is wrong – even if people who declare themselves government is the one doing it.\nGovernments are nothing more than a handful of people and have no right to aggress against others.\nBut humans are taught at a young age to never question this and that belief has kept most of humanity enslaved for centuries.\n﻿\nIt isn’t a surprise that so many have decided to educate their children themselves.\nAnd as schools continue to fail, and authoritarian policies continue to wreak havoc on our society, more will wake up to the absolute horror of what allowing the state to educate our children has done to the moral fabric of humanity.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|371|383\nLoaded_Language|965|981\nLoaded_Language|3326|3341\nLoaded_Language|76|84\nLoaded_Language|110|122\nLoaded_Language|274|280\nLoaded_Language|1172|1180\nLoaded_Language|1391|1398\nLoaded_Language|3091|3099\nLoaded_Language|3238|3251\nLoaded_Language|3273|3284\nLoaded_Language|1230|1239\nRepetition|1284|1296\nRepetition|2153|2161\nRepetition|2420|2427\nRepetition|1727|1734\nRepetition|309|318\nRepetition|248|262\nRepetition|1301|1315\nRepetition|2580|2594\nRepetition|333|341\nRepetition|973|981\nRepetition|1158|1166\nRepetition|1247|1265\nCausal_Oversimplification|2652|2713\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2890|2943\nExaggeration,Minimisation|692|700\nFlag-Waving|3288|3299\nName_Calling,Labeling|185|211."}
{"prompt":"Trump calls on Sessions to stop Mueller’s Russia probe, raising specter of attempted obstruction\n\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to “stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now,” opening the president to further complaints that he is trying to obstruct the investigation into Russia’s election interference and his campaign’s possible complicity.\nTrump is already reportedly under investigation for potential obstruction of the Russia probe led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.\nThe tweet early Wednesday was the president’s most explicit post or statement to date seemingly aimed at getting his attorney general, the nation’s top law enforcement officer, to end the probe\nThe tweet, along with several others Wednesday morning, accelerated the president’s attacks on the investigation, which he claims is tainted by bias.\nThey were likely prompted by the start of the trial on Tuesday of Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, on 18 charges of tax evasion, bank fraud and conspiracy.\n“This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further.\nBob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!” Trump wrote.\nThe president suggested in a subsequent tweet that Manafort was being treated worse than Al Capone, the notorious Prohibition-era Chicago gangster.\n“Where is the Russian Collusion?” Trump added.\nTrump’s tweets prompted Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, to accuse the president of obstruction “hiding in plain sight.”\n“The President of the United States just called on his Attorney General to put an end to an investigation in which the President, his family and campaign may be implicated,” Schiff tweeted.\n“This is an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight.\nAmerica must never accept it.”\nAlthough the White House has said that Trump’s tweets are official presidential statements, his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, responded to the latest one as he has before, by brushing off suggestions that Trump’s tweets could be used as evidence of obstruction.\n“The president was expressing his opinion on his favored medium for asserting his First Amendment right of free speech,” Giuliani said in an interview.\n“He said ‘should,’ not ‘must,’ and no presidential order was issued or will be.”\nHe said he spoke with Trump to make sure that the president wasn’t actually issuing an order.\n“I talked to him about it to make sure he was on the same page as we are,” Giuliani said, and the president indicated he was not ordering Sessions to act.\nOn Sunday, Giuliani told CBS’ “Face the Nation”: “Obstruction by tweet is not something I think works real well.\nGenerally obstruction is secret, it’s clandestine, it’s corrupt.”\nGiuliani added, “I’ve looked at all those tweets and they don’t amount to anything.”\nFor months, Trump’s lawyers also have argued that it’s impossible for the president to obstruct justice because his constitutional authority extends over the Justice Department.\nThat power allows him to direct officials where to focus their resources or to fire them when he chooses, as Trump did when removing James B. Comey as FBI director last year.\nThat firing, however, led to Mueller’s appointment as special counsel.\nWednesday’s tweet was a reminder of Trump’s unabated anger at Sessions, who recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation on March 2, 2017 — as members of both parties and legal experts have contended that he should.\nSessions pointed to Justice Department regulations to explain that, as one of Trump’s earliest and most active supporters, he shouldn’t participate in the investigation of the Trump campaign.\nHe announced the decision after controversy over his own undisclosed contacts, both during the campaign and the post-election transition, with the Russian ambassador at the time, Sergey Kislyak.\nTwo months ago, Trump tweeted that he should have chosen a different person as attorney general who wouldn’t have needed to recuse himself.\n“I wish I did!” he wrote.\nIn his tweets, Trump also quoted criticism of the investigation from Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor who frequently defends Trump on television.\nIn an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Dershowitz said he does not believe Sessions has the authority to end the probe.\n“You can’t be both recused and making decisions about the investigation,” he said.\nBut Dershowitz also cast doubt on whether Trump’s tweets can be seen as an act of obstruction.\n“You cannot obstruct justice by openly exercising your First Amendment rights and openly criticizing a prosecution, whether you’re right or wrong,” he said.\n“Obstruction of justice is generally committed behind the scenes, so I think both sides are a little overwrought here.”\nStephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor, agreed that Sessions cannot stop the Russia investigation given that he recused himself.\n“The president, intentionally or not, is misdirecting his ire,” Vladeck said.\nIf Trump wanted to use his power to end the probe, he would have to give the order to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general supervising the Mueller team’s work, and fire Rosenstein if he does not comply, according to Vladeck.\nTrump could also try to replace Sessions as attorney general with someone who does not have a conflict of interest from the campaign, allowing that person to relieve Rosenstein of the responsibility to oversee Mueller, Vladeck said.\n— Noah Bierman and Chris Megerian\nLos Angeles Times\n———\n©2018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n>","completion":" Flag-Waving|1044|1206\nExaggeration,Minimisation|557|612\nFlag-Waving|1208|1321\nName_Calling,Labeling|1247|1299\nFlag-Waving|1900|1990\nAppeal_to_Authority|2932|2997\nName_Calling,Labeling|184|206\nLoaded_Language|854|869\nName_Calling,Labeling|1120|1142\nLoaded_Language|1223|1241\nName_Calling,Labeling|1304|1321\nDoubt|1243|1321\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1388|1483\nLoaded_Language|1685|1706\nLoaded_Language|1939|1960\nLoaded_Language|3468|3482\nDoubt|4039|4203\nLoaded_Language|5130|5150\nAppeal_to_Authority|4205|4572\nName_Calling,Labeling|3723|3773."}

{"prompt":"A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?\n\nThe meeting covered Carmels of the Teresian, Discalced, reform from Germany, five areas of Spain, three from France, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Croatia and the Holy Land [1] .\nThe reports from each region showed that many of the provisions found in Cor orans were already in place: federations with broad powers, including financial control and combined formation courses, “religious assistant” priests appointed by the federation and overseeing individual monasteries and superiors giving up their authority to the federations.\nGiven that this was 2009, it is clear that the plans to force all contemplative monasteries in the world into this disastrous European mould were well under way long before Pope Benedict was even considering resigning.\nToday I’ve received an interesting document issued by the Carmelite Order in Europe following a meeting of the “Federations of Discalced Carmelite Nuns of Europe & the Holy Land” in Avila, February 2009.\nAs a snapshot of the current condition of Carmelite monastic life after it had been completely “federated,” it paints a depressing picture; but as a demonstration of what “federations” are likely to achieve once Cor orans is implemented universally, it clangs in the mind like a funeral bell.\nReconciled to managed extinction\nThe report shows average ages of nuns between 65 and 80, “infirmary Carmels,” nuns in state nursing homes, entire communities living in care facilities and half the Carmels with no one in formation.\nSolutions offered are equally uniform: heaped-up bureaucracy, common formation courses between monasteries developed by “religious psychologists,” ever more powers handed to federations.\nThis is federated Carmelite monastic life under Pope Francis’ New Paradigm of fully implemented VaticanTwoism.\nVery little is said of any efforts being made to increase vocational outreach using the internet or through diocesan contacts.\nAnd perhaps most telling of all, not one word is offered of applying any systematic religious solutions; no one is suggesting increased prayer or fasting, Rosary campaigns or novenas in what has to be the Carmelite Order’s most desperate hour.\nNothing is said of increased intensity of devotion to the charism, study of the foundress or returning to sources, still less of strengthening the Carmelites’ traditional independent self-governance or reconsidering the wisdom of “the path taken”.\nIndeed, in one case in Spain, the sisters themselves advocate abandoning traditional Teresian autonomy altogether.\nThe report from Great Britain notes: “18 Carmels have closed in the last 40 years.\nThere have been two amalgamations in recent years and another one involving three Carmels is in process.\nTwo communities at present are living together in one monastery as a temporary measure.”\nThe case of the Netherlands is downright bizarre; sisters so old that even the federation structures are breaking down.\nOnly one fully autonomous functioning Carmel still exists in the Netherlands, and the remains of four entire communities are living in a single care home run by religious brothers.\nBut in this situation, the “solution” undertaken has been an elaborate bureaucratic reshuffle, including gaining approval from Rome, for “a completely new structure,” whose main task, no doubt, will be the making of funeral arrangements and disposing of library books.\nThe atmosphere is weirdly resigned – one federation report recommended simply “forgetting the numbers” – with many notes of mutual congratulation over “unity,” the creating of “links” and the “building of trust” and “dialogue” between communities.\nThe report from Belgium – federated in 1997, average age 73 with one sister in formation for 11 monasteries – states tersely that their biggest problem is “ageing” but under “possible solutions” says only, “We want to continue along the path we have begun.”\nIt is only in the report from Croatia where the problem changes abruptly from aging nuns and no vocations to too many vocations with not enough room[2].\nIt is also notable that it is only in the Croatian report that Christ gets a direct mention.\nFederation of Croatia & Bosnia-Herzegovina: 82 nuns in 5 convents, with an average age of 47, and eleven in formation.\nThis outlier differs from the Western European federations in several respects, notably that it was only federated in 2002.\nBut the effects of the federating\/formation courses are already being felt: “Nowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.”\nPath taken: Have made a foundation in Albania; however this community is not federated.\nFrom the beginning, our Association has organized formation courses for the younger sisters as well as courses of permanent formation.\nEach year, we have one or two seminars, which are also the occasion to the meeting of the Council of the Association.\nThe duration is 3 to 4 days and they take place every time in a different Monastery of the Association.\nWe invite the sisters of other Carmelite convents friends to our formation courses: sisters from Albania, Slovenia and Bulgaria.\nPresent Problems: In general, in our Association the vocations continue growing, but there are differences between the monasteries.\nNowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.\nPossible solutions: We do all what is in our hands in the area of the vocational promotion, collaborating in this way with Christ who calls by his Spirit.\nThese self-generated reports were made in response to a questionnaire set out for the meeting.\nAll speak of nothing but bureaucratic responses: shared “formation courses,” meetings of superiors, amalgamations and suppression of houses and finally “care homes” and houses given over entirely as infirmaries.\nA tale of controlled, systematized extinction.\n~~~\nFederation:

volunteered to help there.\nPossible solutions: two convents intend to amalgamate.\n~~~\nFederation: Spain – Castile Burgos\nDate when erected: 1978\nNumber of convents: 20\nNumber of nuns:

new vocations and held a month long intensive course according to the ratio, given by the same sisters of the federation.\nIn 2004 they established a Carmelite infirmary to help the communities.\nCourses have been organized to accompany the youngest sisters of the federation, given by a religious psychologist.\nPresent problems: ageing of the sisters and a lack of vocations; we have not arrived at any practical conclusion in the way of amalgamations-restructuring though attempts have been made.\nThe incorporation of sisters from other countries without due discernment in some cases.\nPossible solutions: we are making enquiries.\n~~~\nFederation: Spain - Catalonia\nDate when erected: 1993\nNumber of convents 4\nNumber of nuns: 60\nSolemnly professed:\nIn formation:

keep a balance within the communities, based on the present communities and the new vocations.\nPresent Problems: Ageing of the communities, resulting in weakening of life in all its facets.\nIt is not easy to express the reality.\nA lack of vocations is with us as a reality in everyday life.\nMoreover, the high number of Carmels makes difficult to maintain all presences.\nPossible Solutions: It is completely necessary to assume the way of the restructurings, in order to live what is essential, forgetting the numbers.\nThe challenge to grow in confidence and communion should lead us to downgrade the famous and untouchable autonomy because, to a daughter of Saint Teresa, the really important thing is to look for HIM and to live in obedience.\nAnother of our challenges is caring [for] the ecclesial presences.\nWe think this is the way will lead us to recreate from the interior the Charism of the Mother Teresa.\n~~~\nFederation: France - Toulouse Bordeaux\nDate when erected:

convents.\nThe number of vocations has diminished quickly and the numbers increased of those who have left during formation and during the first years of solemn profession.\nNonetheless there have not been amalgamations or suppressions.\nIn some convents old age is a real concern.\nPossible Solutions: They are working on formation through courses.\nAlso on communion between the communities.\nThere are meetings of the Council with the communities.\nWe are ready to accept sisters who cannot be cared for in their own communities.\nHowever, this has not been accepted because they do not want to be separated.\nThe strangest report came from the Netherlands where, for a single surviving autonomous monastery and an average age of 81, resources were mobilised to create “a completely new structure,” complete with approval from the Congregation for Religious:\nFederation: Netherlands\nDate when erected: 1971\nNumber of convents: 6\nNumber of nuns: 73\nSolemnly professed: 73\nIn formation: ....\nAverage age: 81 [NB, the bold was in the original.]\nWhat has been done: 13 Dutch Carmels and one in Iceland have united in a Federation.\nThis has created a close communion from the beginning.\nEveryone has collaborated in the process of amalgamations and suppressions.\nPresent Problems: Only one Carmel functions fully autonomously in the Netherlands.\n4 communities are in a care-home run by the Brothers of the Immaculate Conception.\nAnother Carmel was renewed in 1990.\nAt the original Carmel an infirmary wing has been added for those sisters who require nursing; it is run by Franciscan sisters.\nWith the passing of time the Assembly of the Federation has transferred tasks to the President of the Federation, according to the faculties described in the statutes, in particular regarding our mutual solidarity.\nAlso, with the passing of the years, the Congregation for Religious has placed responsibility directly into the hands of the Council of the Federation.\nFinally, the autonomous Carmels have asked help from the Federation in order to protect their interests.\nDue to our very advanced age in the Netherlands we have reached the moment when a General Assembly is no longer possible.\nWe are left with the problem that in the communities there are no sisters who can or who want to be prioresses or council sisters.\nThe structure of the Federation that we have had till now is thus no longer possible.\nPossible solutions: The Federation Council, the Religious Assistant, together with a canon lawyer of the Dutch Conference of Religious, have worked hard on a completely new structure, in which in its first draft the autonomy of the Carmel has been constantly kept in mind.\nWe began from three points:\n1)Maintenance of the formal autonomy of the Carmels that still exist, but with the chance to transfer tasks gradually to the council of the Federation.\n\n2)Appointment of The Federal board or Federal Council of the Federation, preferably appointed by the Superior General.\nThe team will consist of a president and vice-president who are members of one of the convents, appointed to functions, and of three people who are members, or not, of one of the convents.\n\n3)A Supervisory council, also to be appointed periodically by the Superior General, which will be made up of three members, whose president will be, preferably, a member of a religious institute, preferably of the Carmelite Order and appointed to functions.\nThis council sees itself as a supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the Assembly of the Federation.\nIn October 2008, the President, the Religious Assistant and a Lawyer were in Rome where they explained the proposals.\nThey had meetings with Fr.\nGeneral and with the Congregation for Religious.\nThese were open meetings that helped us to clarify matters.\nAn important concern was that they would allow us to use lay people on the Federal Council of the Federation and the Supervisory council.\nWe were aware that we were not dealing with a simple matter, but we think that, in view of our present situation today, we do not have much choice.\nIt is important to continue to protect the interests of our Federation in the most responsible and careful way, so that all the sisters, even those advanced in years, can continue to live their life in Carmel.\nDefinitive permission came at the 25th of February.\n~~~\nGiven this incredible picture of a Carmelite Order in the last rattle of its death throes, the rest of the summaries of speeches given at the meeting in Avila read as outright surreal, leaving us to wonder if any of these people are attached in any way to reality.\nSr. Enrica Rosanna, the representative of the Vatican’s Congregation for Religious told them that the “two great challenges to our contemplative life” are “the challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy.” She warned the nuns against bringing vocations from other countries to keep their monasteries alive, dropping a hint about what now seems to be a particular obsession of the Congregation.\nCor orans would take this subject up definitively in 2018:\nThe nuns were exhorted to “stay awake to welcome the dawn” of a bright new future:\n“These are difficult and uncertain times, but it is also the time to stay awake as the new dawn is already announcing itself.” “Our aim must be to be open to the future.\nWe should not forget that we are following in the tradition of Teresa of Jesus and in the tradition of all those who have followed in her footsteps.\nIt is a wide road that opens up before us.\nWe must be women of hope and faith.\nWe must always believe that God is the one who directs history.\nFrom this derives our task, to be creative and, at the same time, faithful (creative fidelity).” [emphasis in the original.]\nWhile there can be no doubt that the impending total extinction of the Carmelite Order in Western Europe was foremost in the minds of the nuns present, it seems that the issue was simply not addressed out loud by the representatives of the bureaucracy.\nInstead, Sr. Enrica, after this bizarre and cryptic comment, spoke of the “problems and difficulties that we can encounter” in discernment of mostly non-existent vocations, including “consumerism, modern means of communication, difficulties in creating a stable personality, autonomy of the young, the need to be always supported, the ideology of subjectivism.”\nWhat are these people smoking?\nGiven that this was three years or more from the abdication of Benedict and the installation of the New Paradigm of Francis\/Kasper, one wonders what this “new dawn” was actually about.\nPerhaps a useful question for one of the nuns present could have been, “A ‘new dawn’ of what, exactly?” This kind of coded language has been popular with the progressivist faction in the Church since the 1960s, when the expectation was for the installation of a totally new Church.\nWas Sr. Enrica somehow anticipating the fulfillment of those hippie-era dreams in the years to come?\nIt is certainly clear from Francis’ first acts as pope that he had dealing with conservative and Traditionalist nuns high on his list of priorities.\nHis first appointment, no more than three weeks after the Conclave was Jose Rodrigues Carballo, the Religious Congregation’s Secretary and – given the scandal that erupted on his leaving them – the financial wrecking ball of the Franciscan Friars Minor.\nThe first task Francis gave Carballo was the demolition of the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate.\nCertainly this record of the European Carmelites’ meeting is jammed with hints that Cor orans was on the way.\nOn the final day of the meeting, the “theme for the day” was offered by then-Father General Luis Arostegui: “Government: the need for change.\nAutonomy and Association; autonomy and Fr.\nGeneral; other solutions to government.”\nThe devolution of authority of superiors of individual monasteries to federations was obviously on someone’s mind, as was a plan to see to it that monasteries change superiors frequently: “Essential autonomy can fail due to the relationships within the community: abuses by permanent superiors who decide on the freedom and decisions of the community,” the Father General warned.\nAnd there were certainly hints that a general re-organisation of structures of authority was in the works.\nA common tactic of politicians who want to initiate changes is to “ask questions” rather than make suggestions, and Arostegui asked some very leading questions indeed in this closing address:\n“Who discerns the existence or not of vital autonomy; is it the community or chosen people?\n“Are there instances that work well within the Church which balance autonomy in a way that can be helpful in these situations?\n“At the time of St. Teresa she was an example of someone balanced.\nStability is one reason [for autonomy], but is stability understood in such a way that it can obstruct the spirit of mission and your availability to the Order and to the Church?\n“The valiant and prophetic initiative of Pope Pius XII to create Associations and Federations opened up contemplative life, though it was also thought that it could harm cloister and autonomy.\nCan such essential autonomy continue as it is?\n“50 years ago there was stability.\nHow do we conceive today the relationship between autonomy and Federation-Association and between autonomy and Fr.\nGeneral?\n“Could there be other forms of government?”\nFollowing the Father General’s address are notes from the language groups, including the following:\n“While some communities do not want their autonomy to be touched, and have certain fears of ‘external’ interference, others want a more moderate and flexible autonomy that, without going to the Congregation would have a juridical form, where the President with her Council can intervene in extreme cases that today we watch with pain, our hands tied.\nThough we want these legal channels to be established, it must remain clear what the limits of the Federation Council are, in order to avoid abuses of power on the part of the same.” “...The absence of vital autonomy is also noticed when… the same person remains prioress for years.” “...We need criteria that expand number 203 of our Constitutions and clarify vital autonomy.\nWe perceive that there is a shortage of authority figures.\nWe do not want new figures but rather those that already exist (Associations, [federation] Presidents, Provincials...) be empowered in a legal way (canonically) to help communities in difficulty, for the mission to discern, to counsel, to accompany.” “...We are also concerned for those communities not affiliated to Federations, we see that we should be close to them.”\nMaybe this summary document of 2009 can give us an idea what to expect from Rome in 2018, now that the “progressivist” faction in the Vatican is in the ascendancy and is free to act without restriction.\nWhat comes clear comparing this document to Cor orans is that the Vatican’s machinery has long been at work forcing a uniform and essentially bureaucratic, heavily authoritarian and legalistic vision of contemplative life on anyone who fails sufficiently to resist it.\nAnd with the statistics offered at this meeting we can see clearly where this road leads.\nSo many Catholics in the last 40 years assumed that under the “conservatives” John Paul II and Benedict XVI at least the Vatican was “onside.” At least in Rome they understood the terrible threat of the Bolshie VaticanTwoist revolutionaries.\nBut this report of 2009 shows a clear picture of a Roman congregation determined to see the revolution through to its inevitable conclusion.\n_____________________\n[1] An aside that will perhaps be noteworthy to traditionalist readers is the little comment in the report on the difficulty of having a liturgical observance between all the disparate nations represented at the meeting.\n“Eucharist and Lauds in Spanish.\nFr.\nIsidore D’Silva had prepared a booklet with the liturgy for each day.\nEach psalm was in a different language, and was prepared by the corresponding liturgical group.\nHowever, having the text in front of us made it easier to follow the recitation in other languages.\nThe end result was that we could all join in the liturgy.\nWe were all united in the praise of the Spirit who had brought us there together from different languages and nations.”\n[2] Solution: new foundations, the spreading of the Carmelite charism into new territories.\n[3] This includes all sisters up to final profession, not just postulants and novices.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018\n\nDuring the last 5 years of this papacy, Francis and his Synodal Schemers masterfully manipulated, rigged, and exploited the synodal process.\nThe backdoor tactics and machinations were brilliantly documented by Edward Pentin , Henry Sire, George Neumayr and an array of investigative journalists.\nThe fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.\n– Shakespeare, As You Like It Pope Francis and Cardinal Farrell sit with students at the 2018 pre-synodal meeting for young people.\nThe upcoming October 2018 Synod of Bishops guarantees more synodal antics as the doctrinal culmination of the “Who Am I to Judge” mantra and the recantation of Church teaching on homosexuality.\nPope Francis announced in the Pre-Synodal meeting that the Church will be listening to all the young people and that “no one will be excluded.” That’s code language that the Pope will be “dialoging” and “accompanying” and “hearing” the pro-LBGT agenda.\nOh, the providential irony!\nThe two themes of the upcoming Synod of Bishops in Rome are none other than, Youth and Vocations.\nSound familiar?\nDo I hear the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report?\nHow inconvenient that the two targets of predatory clerics and prelates will be the subject of the Synod of Bishops.\nHow inconvenient that the head of the Synod on Youth and Vocations, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, was the former roommate of the most prolific serial predator of youth and seminarians in the history of the American Church.\nHow inconvenient that Farrell, Head of this Synod on Youth, roomed with the notorious Cardinal Theodore McCarrick for six years and never knew anything about McCarrick’s predatory behavior.\nHow inconvenient that a global homosexual clergy predation scandal is erupting at a time when Francis wants the Synod to minimize that nagging and unmerciful Catholic catechism doctrine of homosexuality as “intrinsically disordered” by exploiting the naive views of the youth at the Synod.\nHow inconvenient that homosexual predation is bankrupting the American Church and the Instrumentum Laboris, the working document of this Vatican Synodal Agenda, embraces the relaxation of the Church teachings on homosexuality.\nHow inconvenient that the homosexual network of clergy and prelates were blasted as predators and coverup enablers in the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, while the Instrumentum Laboris argues that:\n“Some LGBT youths, through various contributions that were received by the General Secretariat of the Synod, wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care by the Church, while some Bishop Conferences ask themselves what to suggest to young people who decide to create homosexual instead of heterosexual couples and, above all, would like to be close to the Church.” §197 IL\nHow inconvenient that during a global prelate homosexual coverup scandal, the 2018 Synodal Bishop Conferences are exploring for ways during the Synod to discuss ways in which homosexual youths want to be “closer” to the Church!\nHow inconvenient that since 2013 during Francis’ impromptu airplane presser when he cleverly sent a powerful message to homosexual clerics, “Who Am I to Judge,” now Francis must judge the criminal predatory conduct of homosexual clergy and prelates who preyed on youth and seminarians.\nThe emerging homosexual clergy scandal is just beginning to unfold.\nThe laity will learn over the course of the next few years that the underlying cause of the criminal scandal lies in the homosexual network of priests, bishops and cardinals who preyed on the youth, assaulted seminarians, promoted their own ilk, and punished any whistleblowers or noncompliant priests.\nHere is the dirty secret that is now emerging.\nMany in the hierarchy were active homosexuals who intentionally relaxed and ignored the Church’s teaching and moral stance on homosexuality.\nThe personal wreckage brutally portrayed in the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report is the direct result of a clerical culture which embraced homosexuality and groomed, recruited, and assaulted young people into this sordid lifestyle.\nMany priests, bishops, and cardinals practiced what Francis preached, ‘who am I to judge.’\nThe result?\nA litany of lives of total moral, physical, emotional devastation suffered by victims of homosexual clerics.\nThis is just the very beginning of the dark night of the soul of the Catholic Church.\nThe upcoming Synod and its embrace of the “LGBT” lifestyle makes a mockery of the suffering of the clergy victims and justifies the decades-old scandal.\nBe forewarned that inviting young people from ages 16-29 to the Synod to discuss vocations with Bishops poses serious moral and physical dangers to these unsuspecting youth, many of whom think homosexuality is cool.\nAnd the Bishops know it.\nThe full extent of the clerical predation in the hierarchy will take years to uncover.\nUntil it has, this Synod must be cancelled while the civil authorities and law enforcement fully investigate the breadth and depth of the homosexual clerical predation.\nThe warning signs and rainbow flags are flamboyantly flashing that the 2018 Synod on the Youth and Vocations in Rome presents great moral and physical exploitation of the youth.\nAccording to the Vatican, the chosen topic of the 2018 Synod, is an “expression of the Church’s pastoral concern for the young,” and is in continuity with the findings of the two-fold synod on the family and Francis’s post-synodal document Amoris Laetitia.\nWe’ve caught on to his sneaky synodal tactics.\nFrancis cleverly uses the synodal process to relax church doctrine by employing secular tools of surveys and focus groups.\nAnd, if the necessary results aren’t computed, they will skewer the results.\nMagisterium by majority vote or stuff the ballot box.\nThe only compelling “expression of the Church’s pastoral concern for the young” belongs in the full and transparent cooperation of criminal investigations into predatory homosexual predation.\nTurn over the documents secret archives involving predation, both in the Vatican and in the chanceries around the globe.\nThat is the only expression that will demonstrate concern for the young.\nSign the Petition to Stop the Synod Here.\n\nEditor's Note: The Remnant has lunched its own #StopTheSynod petition, for those who would rather not go to Change.org.\nOur petition will remain at the top of our site from now until October, or until the Synod is canceled.\nPlease sign and encourage your friends, contacts, and social media associates to do the same.\nMJM\n______________________________\nElizabeth Yore

{"prompt":"'Textbook Definition of Bias'\n\nOn Monday, DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified with FBI boss Christopher Wray before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nIn a predictable performance, the duo cited mistakes and raised concerns but solved none of the lingering mysteries the massive report released last week that found anti-Trump bias did not affect FBI and DOJ decisions.\nOn Tuesday Horowitz performed solo before a joint session of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees.\nOversight chairman Trey Gowdy delivered the opening statement.\nThe attorney general had been accused of “softening or watering down his report,” Gowdy said, “When the reality is it was Jim Comey who softened and watered down his press release, announcing no charges against Secretary Clinton.\nWe see Jim Comey and Jim Comey alone deciding which DOJ policies to follow and which to ignore, to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to support each and every element of an offense and we see Jim Comey and Jim Comey alone deciding whether to send a letter to Congress in the throes of looming election.”\nIn a devastating exchange with Horowitz, Gowdy said that “prejudging the outcome of an investigation before it ends, and prejudging the outcome of an investigation before it begins” is the “textbook definition of bias.” Democrats echoed the IG report’s conclusion that there was no bias.\nRepublicans sought to tie up some loose threads.\nThe IG report confirmed that President Obama communicated with Hillary Clinton on her unsecured email system.\nHorowitz said the president had been one of 13 who had done so.\nRep. Steve King asked about the volume of communications between the president and Clinton.\n“I’ll have to get back to you on that,” Horowitz said, and the IG was “not sure” if any of the communications had involved classified or top secret material.\nIf the IG did know the subject of the president’s communications with Clinton, he failed to reveal any details.\nHorowitz “would have to ask” if his team interviewed any officials at the Obama White House but said “not the president himself.”\nRep. King asked Horowitz about his first encounter with the switch of “extremely careless” for ‘gross negligence,” which violated a criminal statute.\nHorowitz found that Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and James Comey were all involved.\nThe IG also said his team focused on the fact that the classified material on Clinton’s server was “not clearly marked,” which repeated one of Clinton’s claims about her negligence.\nAs for the question of her “intent,” Horowitz said it arose “months earlier,” maybe in 2015, though he couldn’t be sure.\nKing said President Obama had suggested the “careless but not intentional” language in a “60 Minutes” appearance in October of 2015.\nAnd King had observed that in his July 5, 2016 statement, James Comey used “intent” six times.\nHorowitz said Comey “concealed from the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, his intention to make a unilateral announcement in July 2016 about the reasons for his recommendations not to prosecute former Secretary Clinton.” The IG also described his report as a “thorough, comprehensive and objective recitation of the facts.”\nThe IG did confirm that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page worked on the Clinton investigation, the Russia and the Mueller team.\nHorowitz said Strzok and Page had exchanged “tens of thousands of texts.” Ohio Rep. James Jordan asked Horowitz when his team had discovered the message about “we’ll stop” Trump.\nHorowitz conceded that this meant “stop Trump from becoming president.” The IG said they uncovered that text in May, and Jordan asked “why did we not see it until last Thursday?”\n“I can’t answer that,” Horowitz said, adding that it had been sent to Rod Rosenstein’s department at the DOJ.\nJordan concluded that Rosenstein “made the decision that we had to wait a month.”\nSeveral representatives were curious about two FBI agents and one lawyer the IG report had not named.\n“The FBI raised a concern because they work on counterintelligence matters,” Horowitz said.\nRep Mark Meadows asked if the two FBI agents were Kevin Clinesmith and Sally Moyer, which the IG declined to confirm.\n“They don’t work in counterintelligence,” said Meadows, who charged that the FBI gave the IG “false information” and altered key witness reports.\n“How did Comey see the report before it came out?” Rep. Darrell Issa wanted to know.\nHorowitz said Comey didn’t see the whole thing, but explained that he allowed those the IG team had criticized to have a look before release.\nBy the end of the day it was evident that Congress would have to hear from Comey, Rosenstein, Strzok and others.\nHorowitz confirmed that the IG is investigating whether FBI official Peter Strzok’s anti-Trump bias factored into the launch of the bureau’s Russia probe.\nAlso on Tuesday Peter Strzok was “escorted” from the FBI building.\nAs his lawyer told reporters, Strzok had “played by the rules,” but been targeted by “unfounded personal attacks, political games and inappropriate information leaks.”\n“I hope he comes and portrays himself as a victim,” Trey Gowdy told Fox News.\nRep. Bob Goodlatte said the committee would issue a subpoena for Strzok to testify “next week.”\nThat will make for an exciting show on C-SPAN but none of this would be happening if the deep state plot to “stop” Trump had succeeded.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|2168|2186\nLoaded_Language|787|816\nRepetition|982|1011\nLoaded_Language|1099|1110\nLoaded_Language|2193|2209\nLoaded_Language|5320|5335\nRepetition|2497|2507."}
{"prompt":"An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University\n\n​Despite suffering several public and humiliating reversals in various forums and venues, those pushing for boycotts, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against Israel have not dispensed with their pernicious campaign of hate.\nThe latest outrage perpetrated by BDS activists occurred at McGill University, where a Jewish student and two non-Jewish students identified as pro-Israel were removed from their positions as directors of the Students Society of McGill University (SSMU).\nAt the end of his second year, Noah Lew, who is currently third year undergraduate student at McGill University, applied to serve as Director of the School’s student society.\nHe was warned by others who had prior dealings with the SSMU, to keep his Jewish identity secret lest he sabotage his chances.\nThis is the atmosphere that Jewish students and supporters of Israel must endure on a daily basis at McGill.\nThe toxic environment is due almost exclusively to an active and vocal presence of BDS agitators on campus.\nLew followed the advice and was elected as a board member.\nHis “secret” was intact.\nBDS provocateurs at McGill had relentlessly tried and failed to pass boycott resolutions against Israel.\nIn fact, three attempts within an 18-month period were quashed.\nFinally, in June 2016, SSMU’s Judicial Board ruled that the BDS campaign and efforts to institute it at McGill ran counter to the McGill’s undergraduate student union constitution.\nThe Board’s ruling, which is called a “reference,” was then referred to SSMU’s directors for ratification.\nSSMU’s Board of Directors addressed the issue more than a year after the “reference.” Lew and other board members passionately advocated in favor of ratification and their arguments ultimately prevailed over the naysayers.\nThe malevolent BDS campaign at McGill had belatedly come to an ignominious end; or so we thought.\nLew and two other directors identified as either Jewish or pro-Israel became instant targets of a campaign of hate laced with blatant anti-Semitic overtones.\nCampus BDS groups held several meetings to formulate a response and founded the so-called “Democratize SSMU” movement.\nBut Democratize SSMU was anything but democratic.\nIts raison d'être was to seek the removal of Jewish and anti-BDS students from SSMU’s Board of Directors and place BDS back on the agenda.\nAs an aside, one of the more vocal proponents of BDS at McGill is a rancid character named Igor Sadikov, who in February posted a comment on twitter advocating violence against “Zionists.” As a result, he was forced to resign his position as an SSMU director but dodged an impeachment effort to have him stripped of his position at McGill’s Arts Undergraduate Society.\nSadikov made light of his “punch a Zionist” tweet calling it a “misguided joke.” It does not appear that Sadikov was subjected to any form of school disciplinary action despite the fact that his call for violence violated McGill’s Code of Conduct.\nMcGill’s BDS Action Network actively campaigned against Lew and two other board members because of their links to Jewish groups and anti-BDS stances.\nDemocratize SSMU shamefully highlighted Lew’s ethnicity as a reason for his removal.\nAn enlightened, progressive school was suddenly transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws.\nIn October, SSMU’s General Assembly moved to ratify the 12-member Board of Directors.\nAccording to Lew, “historically, the Board of Directors had been ratified as a bloc, all 12 at a time.” But BDS activists who showed up for the General Assembly ratification forced the voting to occur on an individual basis rather than a block as was the accepted protocol.\nIn this manner, BDS\/ Democratize SSMU activists managed to pick off their opponents one at a time.\nIt was repulsive display leftist-fascist bigotry at its worst.\nThe bigoted BDS provocateurs applauded as Lew and the other two board members were removed from their posts.\nBut this time, they may have gone too far.\nEven by BDS standards, their manifestly anti-Semitic campaign antics were beyond the pale.\nBDS activists generally avoid reference to “Jews” by name because it is impolitic and commonly substitute “Zionists” for Jews even though most of us are cognizant of their true intentions.\nBut in the instant case, McGill’s BDS campaigners dispensed with their traditional charade and overtly launched their attack against Jews.\nThe vitriolic BDS campaign immediately sparked outrage among watchdog groups and politicians prompting McGill principal, Suzanne Fortier, to announce that the school would be conducting an investigation into the matter.\nEven SSMU president, Muna Tojiboeva, voiced support for Lew and expressed the belief that antisemitism played a key role in the ousting the three board members.\nOne can only hope that Fortier takes the issue seriously and conducts a proper investigation, which leads to disciplinary action.\nJudging by past “investigations” conducted by other schools – SFSU, CUNY and UCI, to name a few – I am not optimistic.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|238|265\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1999|2059\nLoaded_Language|2802|2816\nLoaded_Language|71|103\nLoaded_Language|278|285\nLoaded_Language|933|954\nName_Calling,Labeling|1016|1029\nName_Calling,Labeling|1125|1141\nLoaded_Language|1280|1292\nName_Calling,Labeling|1805|1832\nDoubt|2180|2228\nSlogans|2765|2780\nLoaded_Language|3153|3163\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3827|3881\nName_Calling,Labeling|3883|3911\nRepetition|3895|3911\nExaggeration,Minimisation|4058|4124\nName_Calling,Labeling|4064|4103\nName_Calling,Labeling|4454|4480\nLoaded_Language|4493|4508\nDoubt|4965|5082\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|697|822\nLoaded_Language|1696|1718\nLoaded_Language|1868|1883\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|3221|3359\nLoaded_Language|4398|4405."}

{"prompt":"Uranium One Bombshell: Evidence of Bribery, Extortion, Kickbacks, Money Laundering, and More!\n\nRight about now the people in the Clinton camp should be getting very nervous about the ongoing investigations into the Uranium One deal.\nWhat must be most annoying for the Clinton team is that these investigations all started as a way to undermine the Trump administration and continue to push connections between Trump and Russia.\nNow, more than a year after the investigations began, it’s looking less likely than ever that President Trump did anything wrong… but the investigations seem to be zeroing in on key Clinton team members (including the Clintons themselves).\nOn Tuesday night Fox News Sean Hannity sat down to talk about the exploding scandal that is the Uranium One deal, and what it could mean for the Clinton family.\nHannity spoke with investigative reporter Sara Carter of Circa, John Solomon of The Hill, and Victoria Toensing, an attorney representing the FBI informant who allegedly possesses documents on the sale of Canadian mining company ‘Uranium One’ to Russia interests back in 2010.\nNow that the NDA (non disclosure agreement) has been lifted Circa’s Sara Carter is “reporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the FBI informant has knowledge of Russia’s involvement in uranium one.”\nNot to be outdone, the Hill’s John Solomon had found even more dirt on this ugly Clinton led deal.\nApparently, Solomon has learned that the FBI informant “has evidence, was on the inside, directly from Putin’s Russia, the push for nuclear fuel deals, and all the crimes we talked about, bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering, all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further.\nGo into your report.”\nThis is all about to get very ugly.\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/_DFeri21hlc\nHANNITY: Breaking news tonight, the Hills John Solomon, investigative reporter Sara Carter, they released bombshell reports equally tonight.\nSolomon reporting according to the memos obtained, the FBI informant that now has had his NDA lifted at the center of this case gathered years and years of evidence of Russia’s plot to control U.S. Nuclear fuel, which included the uranium one deal.\nAnd Sara Carter reporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the FBI informant has knowledge of Russia’s involvement in uranium one.\nAlso joining us now is the attorney for the FBI informant, Victoria Toensing along with John and Sara.\nSara, let’s start with your report.\nA treasure trove, that is huge.\nSARAH CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: It is Sean.\nI mean there’s over 5,000 documents which include emails, briefs, other documentation, memorandums that the informant had turned over to the FBI and Justice Department, and within these documents, it’s very evident of Russia’s intention to enter the American market, energy market.\nAnd their intentions to acquire uranium one.\nHANNITY: John, you go into extensive detail in a very long and hard-hitting piece tonight and revealing piece, how the FBI informant — you actually said six years, I thought he was only an informant for four years.\nHe has evidence, was on the inside, directly from Putin’s Russia, the push for nuclear fuel deals, and all the crimes we talked about, bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering, all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further.\nGo into your report.\nJOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: You know, Sara just said something about the importance of the dominance of the uranium market.\nThis is an email that the FBI has had for six years.\nIt shows that uranium one was part of a Russia strategy to control, not just benefit from the global market, controlled the global market.\nThat would put the United States at a disadvantage.\nThat is the sort of evidence that this FBI informant has right now.\nIf you go back on the last week we heard several things from the Justice Department, there’s no connection to uranium one.\nThese are emails that say uranium one that are in the FBI files.\nThey said that there was no connection between the uranium one case and the criminal case.\nWe now know the criminal case got its first evidence in 2009, a whole year before the uranium one deal was approved by the Obama administration.\nThere are a lot of things that people have been saying that these documents simply don’t agree with.\nHANNITY: All right.\nI got a very high ranking Congressman and that knows, let us put it that way, and actually sent me a note.\nThe knowledge of key administration officials will be the next thing proven by both of you, and the links to the Clinton foundation.\nSara, is that true?\nCARTER: I believe that is true.\nI mean especially when we at —\nHANNITY: Do believe or you know?\nI can’t ask Victoria that question because she won’t tell me.\nCARTER: I know it’s true.\nI know that looking at these documents following the money, following the money is what’s important here.\nThe Justice Department has not pointed out that they will possibly call a special counsel to this.\nThis is still out there.\nThey are looking into it.\nThat is something that they need to decide.\nBut whether it’s a special counsel or whether it’s a prosecutor that is investigating this, they will be able to follow the money.\nThere are somethings said …\nHANNITY: When you say follow the money, my suspicion would go to the money came directly from Russia, was funneled through the Canadian donors to the Clinton Foundation.\nHow good are my instincts?\nCARTER: You have pretty good instincts.\nI think there’s a lot of other areas that they will be looking at as well.\nRemember this is like peeling back an onion.\nYou peel one part and then you find another part.\nAnd that is what’s going to require somebody to do an extensive investigation.\nHANNITY: But it is beginning to cascade Sara.\nCARTER: It is.\nHANNITY: John, I want her to respond to the same thing, that the Clinton Foundation, that this will be traced back to high-ranking Obama administration officials and the Clinton Foundation, and if you add the money portion Sara mentioned?\nSOLOMON: I do.\nI think the place we will be talking about in the next couple weeks as the Clinton global initiative.\nSort of a side project of the Clinton Foundation.\nThere are new flows of money there that we will report on then the next couple of weeks.\nThere were also some personal business projects, some very senior Clinton people that got a remarkable infusion of cash from Russia.\nIt will be able to talk about that in the next couple of weeks.\nAnother layer of interest of the story.\nHANNITY: All right.\nWe have a lot of time in the segment so I want to go very slowly here.\nBoth of you, before I get to Victoria, Sara and John, you both in your pieces said 5,000 documents.\nI hear the number the FBI informant is much, much greater, tens of thousands.\nTrue or false?\nSOLOMON: That seems to be accurate.\nWe have a subset of the documents and they are very voluminous.\nHANNITY: Now let me go to Victoria.\nOne of the great attorneys.\nShe is the most difficult to get any information out of.\nVictoria, one of the things I’ve known about you, and I’ve interviewed you so many times over the years, you now have been doing a deep dive into all of this.\nYou are now representing this FBI informant.\nI think they will become an American hero out of all of this, but apparently, he was fighting and begging and pleading and saying the Russians are here, they are doing this, why are you paying attention?\nI hope my instincts are right there, and number two, how devastating it legally is this going to be based on what I was just asking Sara and John about impacting former Obama officials, money, Clinton foundation?\nVICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING FBI INFORMANT: Let me go to number one first, that is the whole essence of what John and Sara and I are talking about is that in 2009, 2010, our FBI and presumably our Justice Department, and the White House, as my client was told, all knew about this corruption in the Russian nuclear energy area.\nThere’s no separate companies.\nThey are all related.\nThe Russian nuclear energy is controlled from the top, from Putin.\nThey are all one.\nThey all talk to each other.\nSo the evidence about this corruption was known to our government in 2009, 2010, and why is it that CFIUS either wasn’t told, or CFIUS people knowing about it —\nHANNITY: Explain CFIUS, 13 agencies, I am sorry 9 agencies approving the deal that gave control of uranium one to the bad actor, hostile regime, Putin Russia.\nTOENSING: They said, the CFIUS board said that the bad Russians could buy uranium one, which contains access to 20 percent of the U.S.\nUranium, why was that decision made?\nWas CFIUS told?\nDid Bob Mueller go to Eric Holder and tell him?\nEric Holder sat on it.\nHANNITY: He was one of the nine.\nTOENSING: Did Bob Mueller go to the White House and tell him?\nThe FBI agents told my client that they were briefing the President about his conduct.\nOf course, when the CFIUS decision was made.\nMy client said, what happened?\nHANNITY: Back to my original question, counselor, if I may.\nYou are too good at your job.\nThis is a very serious point.\nPutting your legal hat on, objectively speaking, yes they knew, the evidence will prove it based on the documents and your client, crimes committed on a high level?\nNational security compromise?\nTOENSING: Of course, it goes without saying giving the Russians control of the uranium was a national security compromise.\nI think that we are going to have to do is continue to follow the money because the reporting that John and Sara are going to be doing in a few days will be revealing about where lots of the various money went and where it came from.\nHANNITY: Always we go back, and I believe at the end of this you guys deserve a Pulitzer, and I’m not the only one thinking that.\nYou have dug so deep on this, this has been a deep dive and I applaud you both.\nI want to ask as it relates to who knew what, and when.\nWhat did they know, when did they know it, John Solomon?\nI’m talking about Obama, Mueller, Eric Holder, and Hillary Clinton.\nSOLOMON: We are at a little disadvantage right now, because we don’t have those records, and also the records that Congress needs to go get, but I can tell you I have a person quoted in my story who has direct knowledge of what the Justice Department knew.\nThis person said without a shred of doubt, we knew in 2009 a year before CFIUS ruled that Thomas were engaged in criminality, without a shadow of a doubt, we knew that Russia was trying to gain a corner on the U.S. market, get a strong hold on our uranium, and without a doubt we knew they were using political levers to try to get their way here.\nWe are talking about control, like this document says, they are trying to gain control of our markets.\nThat has to be national security interest that should have been raised in CFIUS.\nHANNITY: President daily briefings were told.\nHad this information in it before CFIUS approves this.\nCARTER: Sean.\nThat is what we need to find out.\nWe need to see those Presidential daily briefings.\nCongress can get those.\nThey will be able to know whether or not President Obama was briefed on this and according to a number of people that I have spoken with as well, he was.\nI think that will reveal a whole other layer of who knew what, where and when.\nAnd we follow the money and it will reveal even more about Hillary Clinton and what she knew and when did she know it, and the other members of the CFIUS board.\nHANNITY: And Obama and Holder and Mueller?\nJohn, real quick, we are running out of time.\nSOLOMON: yes listen, I think even Sessions and Rosenstein have questions to answer.\nThere are people in Congress who don’t think they’ve gotten a straight answer from them.\nHANNITY: All right.\nVictoria, we get the last word from you, laws broken?\nTOENSING: Well, of course.\nHANNITY: You are so good at your job.\nYou are so annoyingly good.\nThe American people deserve the truth varied our security was compromised, we import uranium, because we don’t have enough.\nNewt Gingrich will weigh in on this and more things and about the Clintons.\nAre they facing their day of reckoning?\nAnd a big announcement at the end of the show.\nArticle posted with permission from

Grassley would not change the date of the hearing set for Monday.\nEven Senators Jeff Flake, Bob Corker and Lindsey Graham, who have all said Ford needs to be heard, have indicated that if she does not show up for Monday's hearing, they will schedule a vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation.\nOn Thursday afternoon, Ford's highly partisan, activist attorney emailed Grassley saying, although her client strongly prefers that an investigation take place beforehand, Ford will testify next week, but she cannot do so on Monday.\nAnd she will only be questioned by members of the Senate panel, not outside lawyers.\nWhy not Monday?\nDoes she have an important dentist appointment she can't get out of?\nIn order to avoid the criticism that will no doubt come anyway, the Republicans on the Senate Judicial committee have tried very hard to oblige Ford's requests, even offering to go to California to hear her testimony.\nShe and her attorneys feel that they are in the driver's seat and thus, can call all the shots.\nDemocrats want to delay this vote until after the midterms because they believe they have a chance to retake the Senate as well as the House.\nRush Limbaugh points out that the Senate has bent over backwards to accommodate the accuser.\n\"I don’t care who you are, determine the scope and the parameters of an investigation.\nThe accuser doesn’t get to determine when and who investigates.\nIn no circumstance in the country does that happen.\"\nIn addition to the political reasons for the delay requests, it appears as if this woman is reluctant to testify under oath, possibly because she doesn’t want to perjure herself.\nMaybe she realizes the magnitude of what her accusations have unleashed.\nEither this did not happen at all or a much milder version of the situation she alleges occurred.\nKavanaugh may have made a pass at her as 17-year-old boys (and even some 17-year-old girls) are known to do.\nFord said no and that was it.\nEven she admits, they did not have sex, nor was this a hostage situation.\nThe perception of events by a 15-year-old girl may differ significantly from reality.\nAnd 36 years can distort memories, one way or another.\nWhat is happening in the Brett Kavanaugh nomination process should concern every American.\nWhatever happened or did not happen, it's difficult to feel sorry for someone who comes forward at such a politically opportune moment.\nThere was ample time to have addressed this in July or August, but Dianne Feinstein chose to sit on it until the moment it could inflict maximum political damage.\nDemocrats may be overestimating the strength of their hand.\nAnd Ms. Ford may be overestimating the integrity of the \"supportive\" lawmakers and lawyers currently handling her.\nWatch all these sensitive lawmakers and high profile, activist attorneys scatter like mice from her once the Senate vote is over (regardless of the result).\nFord can choose to state her case on Monday or not, but she is not in a position to be calling the shots.\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_fear-prejudice|0|91\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1722|1749\nLoaded_Language|1817|1830\nName_Calling,Labeling|1858|1891\nFlag-Waving|2402|2428\nName_Calling,Labeling|4190|4224\nLoaded_Language|5064|5083\nFlag-Waving|6020|6109\nLoaded_Language|6658|6675\nLoaded_Language|207|230\nFlag-Waving|2218|2270\nDoubt|4478|4561\nCausal_Oversimplification|4877|5017\nDoubt|168|269\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|2272|2383\nLoaded_Language|2696|2711\nLoaded_Language|5113|5137\nCausal_Oversimplification|6331|6408\nDoubt|6490|6583\nName_Calling,Labeling|6527|6560\nName_Calling,Labeling|6601|6657\nDoubt|1484|1576\nFlag-Waving|5263|5313."}

{"prompt":"Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus\n\nEditor’s Note: Over the years, Bishop Robert Morlino of the Diocese of Madison has confirmed several of my children according to the traditional Rite of Confirmation, as his diocese has been a port in the storm for many displaced and disillusioned Catholic families.\nWe don’t see eye-to-eye on everything, of course, but his faith and pastoral solicitude have for us been a light in the darkness and proof that God has not left us orphans.\nAnd now this, finally, a bishop with the courage to look the beast in the eye and speak its name out loud.\nBishop Morlino does this in a moment when he is under heavy attack as a “hater” for defending the Church’s teaching on marriage—an attack, by the way, which prompted us here at The Remnant to join the fight to DEFEND BISHOP MORLINO last year.\n\"If you'll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred!\nAs I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity.\nAs the Book of Proverbs says 'My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov.\n8:7).'\nIt is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.\n– Bishop Robert Morlino\nThis is what a courageous shepherd looks like!\nIn our opinion, during the most vile clergy sex scandal in history, every bishop in the country must do exactly what Bishop Morlino has done, i.e., issue a statement of fidelity to the Church’s moral theology, specifically her teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts.\nIn so doing, the bishops will incur the wrath of the enemies of the Church, yes.\nThey will be crucified in the media, yes.\nBut they will also be doing their sacred duty before God in reassuring their thoroughly scandalized flocks that they are absolutely committed to the defense and enforcement of the Church’s moral teaching at a time when it is under scurrilous attack from within.\nNothing less will do.\nBishop Morlino has now done it, and we respectfully demand that the rest of the American bishops either follow suit or face the charge of being complicit with the degenerate and even criminal shepherds, accounts of whose betrayal and vice now dominate the news.\nMay God bless and keep Bishop Robert Morlino.\nMJM\nBishop Robert C. Morlino's letter to the faithful on the ongoing sexual abuse crisis in the Church\nAugust 18, 2018\nDear brothers and sisters in Christ of the Diocese of Madison,\nThe past weeks have brought a great deal of scandal, justified anger, and a call for answers and action by many faithful Catholics here in the U.S. and overseas, directed at the Church hierarchy regarding sexual sins by bishops, priests, and even cardinals.\nStill more anger is rightly directed at those who have been complicit in keeping some of these serious sins from coming to light.\nFor my part — and I know I am not alone — I am tired of this.\nI am tired of people being hurt, gravely hurt!\nI am tired of the obfuscation of truth.\nI am tired of sin.\nAnd, as one who has tried — despite my many imperfections — to lay down my life for Christ and His Church, I am tired of the regular violation of sacred duties by those entrusted with immense responsibility from the Lord for the care of His people.\nThe stories being brought into light and displayed in gruesome detail with regard to some priests, religious, and now even those in places of highest leadership, are sickening.\nHearing even one of these stories is, quite literally, enough to make someone sick.\nBut my own sickness at the stories is quickly put into perspective when I recall the fact that many individuals have lived through them for years.\nFor them, these are not stories, they are indeed realities.\nTo them I turn and say, again, I am sorry for what you have suffered and what you continue to suffer in your mind and in your heart.\nIf you have not already done so, I beg you to reach out, as hard as that may be, and seek help to begin to heal.\nAlso, if you’ve been hurt by a priest of our diocese, I encourage you to come forward, to make a report to law enforcement and to our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator, so that we might begin, with you as an individual, to try and set things right to the greatest extent possible.\nThere is nothing about these stories that is okay.\nThese actions, committed by more than a few, can only be classified as evil, evil that cries out for justice and sin that must be cast out from our Church.\nFaced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the Church, I have been tempted to despair.\nAnd why?\nThe reality of sin — even sin in the Church — is nothing new.\nWe are a Church made of sinners, but we are sinners called to sanctity.\nSo what is new?\nWhat is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church, and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others.\nUnless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity, we, as an institution and as individuals, will continue to suffer the “wages of sin.”\nFor too long we have diminished the reality of sin — we have refused to call a sin a sin — and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy.\nIn our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\nIn order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation.\nWhy do we do this?\nIs it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being “pastoral?” Have we covered over the truth out of fear?\nAre we afraid of being disliked by people in this world?\nOr are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives?\nPerhaps these are the reasons, but perhaps it is more or less complex than this.\nIn the end, the excuses do not matter.\nWe must be done with sin.\nIt must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable.\nLove sinners?\nYes.\nAccept true repentance?\nYes.\nBut do not say sin is okay.\nAnd do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave, lasting consequences.\nFor the Church, the crisis we face is not limited to the McCarrick affair, or the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, or anything else that may come.\nThe deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the Church.\nThere is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching, our preaching, our decision making, and our very way of living.\nIf you’ll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred!\nAs I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity.\nAs the Book of Proverbs says “My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov.\n8:7).” It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.\nThere must be no room left, no refuge for sin — either within our own lives, or within the lives of our communities.\nTo be a refuge for sinners (which we should be), the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled.\nIn this I speak of all sin.\nBut to be clear, in the specific situations at hand, we are talking about deviant sexual — almost exclusively homosexual — acts by clerics.\nWe’re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests, bishops, and cardinals.\nWe are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some, in short, sacrilege, but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all.\nTo call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further.\nThere has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now-culturally-acceptable acts of homosexuality from the publically-deplorable acts of pedophilia.\nThat is to say, until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia — this despite clear evidence to the contrary.\nIt is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more.\nTo fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable — neither the abuse of children, nor any use of one’s sexuality outside of the marital relationship, nor the sin of sodomy, nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all, nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority.\nIn this last regard, special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case, that being the allegations of former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick’s (oft-rumored, now very public) sexual sins, predation, and abuse of power.\nThe well-documented details of this case are disgraceful and seriously scandalous, as is any covering up of such appalling actions by other Church leaders who knew about it based on solid evidence.\nWhile recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by Archbishop McCarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light, long-ignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification.\nIt is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord.\nThe Church’s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful, but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest.\nAnd the decision to act upon this disordered inclination is a sin so grave that it cries out to heaven for vengeance, especially when it involves preying upon the young or the vulnerable.\nSuch wickedness should be hated with a perfect hatred.\nChristian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness.\nBut while hating the sin, we must never hate the sinner, who is called to conversion, penance, and renewed communion with Christ and His Church, through His inexhaustible mercy.\nAt the same time, however, the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense.\nIn fact, a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy, because, while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed, it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life (if he willingly accepts his punishment), thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come.\nMotivated, therefore, by love and concern for souls, I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty.\nThe sins and crimes of McCarrick, and of far too many others in the Church, bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests, bishops, and cardinals, and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians.\nThe result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ’s name.\nIt causes others to sin in their thoughts, words, and deeds — which is the very definition of scandal.\nAnd the second mistrust harms the future of the Church, since our future priests are at stake.\nI said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this.\nHowever, that temptation quickly passed, thanks be to God.\nNo matter how large the problem, we know that we are called to go forward in faith, to rely upon God’s promises to us, and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can, within our spheres of influence.\nI have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters, and I have begun to, and will continue to, talk with the priests of the diocese, as well as the faithful, in person and through my weekly column and homilies, making things as clear as I can, from my perspective.\nHere now, I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese:\nIn the first place, we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese.\nThis is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance, nor our efforts to improve.\nWe must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented, requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry, as well as across-the-board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals.\nHere again, I state, as we have done consistently, if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church, contact law enforcement.\nIf you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources.\nIf you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood, we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first, but even if you don’t want to, please still reach out to us.\nTo our seminarians: If you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me and to the seminary rector.\nI will address it swiftly and vigorously.\nI will not stand for this in my diocese or anywhere I send men for formation.\nI trust that the seminaries I choose, very discriminately, to help form our men will not ignore this type of scandalous behavior, and I will continue to verify that expectation.\nTo our priests: Most simply, live out the promises you made on your ordination day.\nYou are called to serve Christ’s people, beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours.\nThis is to keep you very close to God.\nIn addition, you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop.\nIn obedience, strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest, a hard working priest, and a pure and happy priest — as Christ Himself is calling you to do.\nAnd by extension, live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ, the Church, and the people whom he has called you to serve.\nGod will give you the graces to do so.\nAsk Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day.\nAnd if you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me.\nI will not stand for this in my diocese any more than in our seminaries.\nTo the faithful of the diocese: If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest, bishop, cardinal, or any employee of the Church, bring it forward.\nIt will be addressed quickly and justly.\nIf you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse, bring it forward as well.\nSuch actions are sinful and scandalous and we cannot allow anyone to use their position or power to abuse another person.\nAgain, in addition to injuring individuals, these actions injure the very Body of Christ, His Church.\nFurthermore, I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate, priesthood, our parishes, schools, universities, and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would-be sexual predator or accomplice;\nI will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish, and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed;\nI will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood.\nFailure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship;\nI will continue to require (with our men and our funds) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests, in the image of Christ;\nI ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities, the faithful in the pews, and to God Almighty, not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church, but our seminarians, university students, and all the faithful as well.\nI promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest, or any Church employee, guilty of abuse;\nI ask everyone reading this to pray.\nPray earnestly for the Church and all her ministers.\nPray for our seminarians.\nAnd pray for yourselves and your families.\nWe must all work daily on our own personal holiness and hold ourselves accountable first and, in turn, hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well, and\nFinally, I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy.\nI will be offering a public Mass of reparation on Friday, September 14, the Feast of the Triumph of the Holy Cross, at Holy Name Heights and I ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes.\nIn addition, I ask that all priests, clergy, religious, and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming Autumn Ember Days (Sep. 19, 21, and 22) as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and I invite all the faithful to do the same.\nSome sins, like some demons, can only be driven out by prayer and fasting.\nThis letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the Church to begin to heal from, and stave off, this deep illness in the Church, but rather the next steps I believe we can take locally.\nMore than anything else, we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil.\nWe must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness.\nWe must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors — myself included — that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness.\nWe must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth.\nAgain, right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country, calling for real reform and “house cleaning” of this type of depravity.\nI stand with them.\nI don’t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally.\nBut I do know this, and I make this my last point and last promise, for the Diocese of Madison: “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.”\nFaithfully yours in the Lord,\nMost Rev.\nRobert C. Morlino\nBishop of Madison\nThis text first appeared in the Madison Catholic Herald.\n>","completion":" Repetition|2944|2954\nRepetition|2964|2974\nRepetition|3011|3021\nRepetition|3051|3061\nRepetition|3177|3187\nRepetition|13333|13358\nRepetition|14442|14467\nRepetition|16466|16470\nRepetition|16519|16523\nRepetition|16549|16553\nRepetition|3591|3599\nRepetition|5135|5138\nRepetition|14834|14844\nLoaded_Language|8867|8878\nLoaded_Language|7243|7257\nLoaded_Language|1586|1596\nLoaded_Language|3254|3261\nLoaded_Language|2997|3009\nLoaded_Language|3485|3494\nLoaded_Language|4434|4438\nLoaded_Language|8883|8903\nLoaded_Language|8935|8952\nLoaded_Language|9663|9717\nLoaded_Language|9794|9804\nLoaded_Language|9815|9842\nLoaded_Language|13309|13331\nLoaded_Language|13520|13530\nLoaded_Language|14823|14844\nLoaded_Language|1370|1385\nLoaded_Language|1817|1846\nLoaded_Language|3373|3388\nLoaded_Language|9347|9401\nLoaded_Language|17788|17830\nLoaded_Language|1653|1691\nLoaded_Language|17440|17457\nLoaded_Language|483|504\nLoaded_Language|866|887\nLoaded_Language|926|961\nLoaded_Language|6315|6393\nLoaded_Language|6561|6601\nLoaded_Language|14986|15028\nLoaded_Language|16614|16639\nLoaded_Language|17980|18035\nLoaded_Language|601|654\nLoaded_Language|1711|1720\nLoaded_Language|1971|1981\nName_Calling,Labeling|726|735\nName_Calling,Labeling|1304|1325\nName_Calling,Labeling|2183|2225\nName_Calling,Labeling|7820|7867\nName_Calling,Labeling|7877|7917\nName_Calling,Labeling|300|319\nName_Calling,Labeling|572|654\nName_Calling,Labeling|1811|1846\nName_Calling,Labeling|3233|3317\nName_Calling,Labeling|4434|4471\nName_Calling,Labeling|5514|5522\nName_Calling,Labeling|7410|7450\nName_Calling,Labeling|10905|10959\nName_Calling,Labeling|10993|11030\nName_Calling,Labeling|11035|11072\nName_Calling,Labeling|13920|13988\nSlogans|866|887\nSlogans|2286|2330\nSlogans|2944|2962\nSlogans|18812|18834\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1361|1404\nExaggeration,Minimisation|9113|9135\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1698|1738\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1852|1943\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3534|3578\nExaggeration,Minimisation|8632|8678\nExaggeration,Minimisation|9347|9373\nExaggeration,Minimisation|9661|9717\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|4907|5047\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1740|2022\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|5821|5941\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|15632|15697\nCausal_Oversimplification|1192|1265\nCausal_Oversimplification|5145|5206\nCausal_Oversimplification|6832|6905\nCausal_Oversimplification|7580|7638\nCausal_Oversimplification|10488|10673\nCausal_Oversimplification|4363|4517\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|1338|1615\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|17034|17229\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|2060|2284\nDoubt|5425|5738."}

{"prompt":"Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic\n\nIn his eleven-page account, affirmed under oath, the Archbishop, marking a turning point in Church history, declares that senior Vatican officials, including former Secretaries of State Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone as well as Cardinal Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga, coordinator of Pope Bergoglio’s “Council of Cardinals”, covered up McCarrick’s decades of sexual predation and that Bergoglio himself continued the coverup.\nThis article was first written to address the neo-Catholic commentator Massimo Faggioli’s attempt , following the Pennsylvania grand jury report and the fall of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, to minimize the homosexual crisis in the Church and blunt the correlative rise of what he derides as “neo-traditionalism.” As my piece was about to go to press, however, EWTN’s National Catholic Register broke the explosive story on the written testimony of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò , former apostolic nuncio to the United States (2011 to 2016).\nFaggioli’s propaganda piece now becomes merely illustrative of the points to be made here in light of this astonishing and indeed providential development.\nRegarding Bergoglio, Viganò testifies that in 2013 he personally informed him about McCarrick’s history, the dossier of the Congregation for Bishops on his sexual crimes against boys and young men, and the disciplinary sanctions imposed upon him by Benedict XVI (forbidding residence in a seminary, public appearances and Masses).\nEvidently already aware of these facts, however, Bergoglio not only rehabilitated McCarrick but made him a “trusted counselor” who advised the elevation of the pro-homosexual prelates Blase Cupich, Joseph Tobin and Kevin Farrell to the College of Cardinals and the prominent episcopal sees they now discredit.\nAll of this happened before Bergoglio, bowing to worldwide public pressure, finally—only weeks ago—took decisive action against his “trusted counselor.” McCarrick had lobbied for Bergoglio’s election, along with Maradiaga and the infamous Cardinal Danneels, who covered up homosexual rape committed by a priest against his own nephew,has supported “same-sex marriage,” and advised the King of Belgium to sign a law legalizing abortion in 1990.\nAs Edward Pentin notes: “all 3 prelates have since been special advisors of Francis or rehabilitated by him.”\nViganò concludes his testimony by declaring that all of the prelates involved (many others are implicated), including Bergoglio, should resign their offices for the good of the Church.\nAs to Bergoglio in particular, he courageously states openly the truth that so many of his brethren know but fear to speak in public:\nI want to recall this indefectible truth of the Church’s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former Archbishop of Washington, Theodore McCarrick; by the grave, disconcerting and sinful conduct of Pope Francis and by the conspiracy of silence of so many pastors, and who are tempted to abandon the Church, disfigured by so many ignominies.\nAt the Angelus on Sunday, August 12, 2018 Pope Francis said these words: “Everyone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ...\nIf we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it.\nWe need to intervene where evil is spreading; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking.” [emphasis in original] If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer, how much graver is it for the Church’s supreme pastor, who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt.\nHe followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert, thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by McCarrick.\nAnd how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church!\n[my emphasis] Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren.\nIndeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ’s flock.\nIn this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick’s abuses and resign along with all of them.\n[emphasis in original]\nBefore he was papal nuncio in Washington, Viganò headed the Governorate of Vatican City State after having served as Nuncio in Nigeria, a Delegate for the Pontifical Representatives of the Secretary of State of the Holy See and a Member of the Disciplinary Commission of the Roman Curia.\nIn those capacities he had access to documents and witnesses that corroborate his own firsthand testimony.\nWith Viganò’s testimony, the widespread homosexual infiltration of the post-Vatican II hierarchy, from the top on down, now emerges mountainously into view, never to be buried again.\nEven before that testimony, however, the fall of McCarrick and the Pennsylvania grand jury report had already presented a Sisyphean task to neo-Catholic apologists for the decrepit Novus Ordo status quo and the ill-starred Council that launched its installation.\nYet there is little doubt they will continue the same polemic that for nearly sixty years has doggedly defended every one of the ruinous “reforms” that have resulted in a debacle without equal in Church history, even considering the Arian crisis of the 4th century.\nThose “reforms” included abandonment of the Vatican’s strict pre-conciliar instruction (1961) that “advancement to religious vows and ordination should be barred to those who are afflicted with evil tendencies to homosexuality or pederasty, since for them the common life and the priestly ministry would constitute serious dangers.” Today, neo-Catholic commentators, cowed by the demands of political correctness, refuse to state the simple truth that homosexuality is a perversion that precludes ordination as does any other grave psychological disorder.\nKill the Messenger\nI suspect that not even Viganò’s historic testimony will change the neo-Catholic position.\nQuite the contrary, I would expect the neo-Catholic commentariat either to ignore Viganò’s witness, explain away his revelations or, failing that, make every effort to smear the man.\nThe campaign to discredit Archbishop Viganò began instantaneously on the Catholic left wing.\nOnly hours after Viganò’s sworn testimony appeared online, the professional Catholic dissident Sean Michael Winters, writing for National Catholic Reporter, smeared the former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, who holds doctorates in both civil and canon law, as “a trafficker in conspiracy theories who mixes fact, fiction and venom,” “more than a little obsessed with homosexuality”—like Oliver Stone, who “was obsessed with the grassy knoll”—“a disgruntled former employee” and “always a crackpot.” Without addressing the merits, Winters dismissed Archbishop Viganò’s “wild claims” about bishops who are “subverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality” and accused the Archbishop, along with unnamed other bishops and archbishops, of “speak[ing] about gay people with such hatred…”\nWinters issues the dire warning that “A putsch is afoot and if the U.S. bishops do not, as a body, stand up to defend the Holy Father in the next 24 hours, we shall be slipping towards schism long before the bishops’ meeting in November.\nThe enemies of Francis have declared war.” Notice that for Winters it is not the Church or the integrity of her doctrine and discipline that must be defended against enemies, but only Bergoglio and the regime of novelty he is leading to its final extremity.\nJohn Allen’s instant analysis attempting to impeach Viganò’s testimony is, as one would expect from him, a bit craftier.\nHis opinion is: “Take it seriously, but with a large grain of salt.” Which is just Allen’s more nuanced way of saying: “Don’t believe it.” Allen’s view is supported by such irrelevancies as the fact that Viganò’s account implicates “no fewer than 32 senior churchmen” (so what?\n), that he “has a history” of “innuendo and conspiracy theories” (a gratuitous assertion unsupported by evidence of falsity), that he allegedly quashed an investigation of Archbishop John Nienstedt and ordered evidence destroyed (an allegation Viganò has immediately and categorically denied with conclusive supporting documents, but in any event a tuo quoque fallacy) and that Allen has “the impression that all this was orchestrated with a political agenda in mind” (the same “conspiracy theory” mentality he gratuitously attributes to Viganò).\nMark Shea, easily the most insufferable of the neo-Catholic polemicists, has quickly followed Winters and Allen in trying to cast doubt on Viganò ’s claims.\nIgnoring eleven pages of detail, written and published under oath, he suggests there has been no “Documentation.\nEvidence.\nProof.” Yes, Francis should resign if Viganò ’s allegations are true, Shea admits—a stunning concession coming from him.\nYet, making no attempt to refute Viganò’s account on the merits, he tries to wave it all aside with his usual mode of argument—puerile mockery: “But at present, the eagerness of the Greatest Catholics of All Time to believe and repeat everything their itching ears want to hear about this Pope whose living guts they have hated from the moment of his election only tells in his favor, not against it.” Shea’s ever-expanding opus of digital invective never seems to rise above this sort of crude ad hominem attack: Well, if those people believe it, it can’t be true.\nThe neo-Catholic propaganda mill will have a very difficult time smearing this witness, however.\nSpeaking to Catholic News Agency, Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, who served as first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington, confirmed that “Viganò said the truth.\nThat’s all,” when he stated in his sworn account that Nuncio Pietro Sambi conveyed to McCarrick at the Nunciature in Washington the sanctions that had been imposed on him by Pope Benedict—sanctions Bergoglio ignored for five years until forced to act by a worldwide storm of outrage.\nFurthermore, a series of prelates has vouched for Viganò’s character and credibility:\n- Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas has gone so far as to order all the priests in his diocese to read from the pulpit a statement that he finds Viganò’s allegations credible.\n- Bishop Thomas Olmsted of Phoenix, Arizona, issued a statement affirming that he has known Viganò for 39 years, has “always known and respected him as a man of truthfulness, faith and integrity” and that his testimony should “be taken seriously by all…”\n- Archbishop Allen Vigneron of Detroit, Michigan issued a statement calling Viganò’s account “another daunting challenge to our confidence in the reliability of the Church’s leadership, during a summer of devastating news regarding clergy sexual abuse and infidelity.” (The statement has since apparently been scrubbed from the diocesan website.)\n- Bishop Athanasius Schneider declares: “Archbishop Viganò confirmed his statement by a sacred oath invoking the name of God.\nThere is, therefore, no reasonable and plausible cause to doubt the truth content of the document of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò.”\n- Cardinal Raymond Burke’s statement declares: “The declarations made by a prelate of the authority of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò must be totally taken to heart by those responsible in the Church.”\n- [And just two days ago, Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco wrote a letter to his faithful which \"speaks to Vigano's integrity and sincere love of the Church.\"]\nIn another setback for the propaganda machine gearing up to impeach Viganò’s testimony, the Catholic Herald has just reported that Cardinal Wuerl must have known full well from Viganò himself that McCarrick was under Pope Benedict’s papal sanctions on account of his sexual misconduct because, as an Archdiocesan spokesman now confirms, at Viganò’s request as then papal nuncio Wuerl had to cancel a public appearance by McCarrick not long before Bergoglio’s election.\nThe Herald asks the obvious question: “[I]f Cardinal Wuerl was unaware of the sanctions, and unaware of the reason for them, why did he ask no questions of the nuncio regarding the reason for his demand?” The question answers itself, and Viganò’s testimony on this critical point stands confirmed by Wuerl’s own spokesman.\nBergoglio Pleads the Fifth\nBergoglio himself, however, has already precluded any attempt to impeach Viganò’s testimony.\nDuring the return flight from Dublin after the “World Meeting of Familes,” he was asked to comment on Viganò ’s allegations that he had informed Bergoglio of McCarrick’s crimes in 2013 as well as the sanctions imposed by Benedict.\nBergoglio declined to incriminate himself:\nRead the statement carefully yourselves and make your own judgment.\nI am not going to say a word about this.\nI believe that the statement speaks for itself, and you all have sufficient journalistic ability to draw conclusions.\nIt is an act of trust.\nWhen a little time goes by, and you have drawn conclusions, perhaps I will speak about it, but I would like your professional maturity to do this work.\nIt will do you all good, really.\nIn other words, as Bergoglio cannot deny the allegations without lying, he will say nothing at all about them in the hope they will go away—with the help of sycophants in the Vatican press corps and shifty polemicists like Shea, who expects his readers to swallow his explanation that Bergoglio’s refusal to say anything in his defense when asked point blank about the charges against him “seems to me to obviously be the reply of somebody who believes the accusations are groundless…”.\nSeems to be.\nObviously.\nThe American “Gay” Church Expansion\nWhile events have overtaken Faggioli’s piece, it will remain useful here as a prime example of the neo-Catholic polemic.\nThat polemic seeks to shore up the collapsing Novus Ordo establishment lest it give way to the dreaded traditionalist revival.\nBut before I address Faggioli’s latest defense of the indefensible, some background is in order, including a discussion of further key details of Viganò’s testimony.\nFirst of all, as I predicted 16 years ago, because the Vatican under John Paul II had no intention of enforcing the pre-conciliar ban on admission of homosexuals to the seminary “a new bumper crop of homosexual ordinands is guaranteed—and with it a new harvest of scandal for the Church.” That prediction came immediately after the “pedophile summit” of 2002 in Rome, which I attended as The Remnant’s correspondent.\nIn answer to my question then head of the USCCB, Wilton Gregory, made an explosive admission reportedby the international press: “it is an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.” The struggle, to the extent there even was one, obviously has been lost.\nSixteen years later, the homosexual predator McCarrick has finally been exposed to the world, stripped of his cardinal’s hat and deprived of any ministry, but only after international media coverage of the Vatican’s semi-secret finding that McCarrick had raped a teenage altar boy 47 years ago.\nIf not for that one case, McCarrick’s sixty years of homosexual debauchery might well have gone unpunished in this world and he would have died still possessed of all the phony honors that had been heaped upon him throughout his career as a parasite in the Body of Christ, including the favor shown to him by Bergoglio.\nThe telling details of Archbishop Viganò’s testimony concerning Bergoglio’s friendly relations with McCarrick before he finally had to cut him loose—details conveniently ignored by Winters, Allen and Shea—are utterly devastating to any defense of Bergoglio.\nThis would explain why he will not a “say a word about” Viganò’s charges against him.\nThe Archbishop reveals, as already noted, that Pope Benedict imposed sanctions on McCarrick under which he “was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.” Viganò further reveals that those sanctions were communicated to McCarrick by then Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi, but were also repeated by Viganò himself when he succeeded Sambi as Nuncio:\nI repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature.\nThe Cardinal, muttering in a barely comprehensible way, admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance.\nViganò testifies that on June 23, 2013, he obtained a private audience with Bergoglio after having encountered McCarrick at the Pope’s residence three days earlier, during which encounter McCarrick had told him with an air of triumph: “The Pope received me yesterday, tomorrow I am going to China” (evidently to assist in negotiating Bergoglio’s planned sellout of China’s underground Catholics to the Communist dictators of Beijing).\nViganò wanted to know why McCarrick had apparently been relieved of the sanctions.\nDuring the audience Bergoglio queried: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” and Viganò replied with the truth Bergoglio obviously did not want to hear:\nI answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naiveté: “Holy Father, I don’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him.\nHe corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.” The Pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face, as if he had already known the matter for some time, and he immediately changed the subject.\nBut then, what was the Pope’s purpose in asking me that question: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not….\nIt was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis’s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews….\nHe [Bergoglio] knew from at least June 23, 2013 [the date of the audience with Viganò] that McCarrick was a serial predator.\nAlthough he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end; indeed, he made McCarrick’s advice his own, which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church.\nIt was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action to save his image in the media.\n[all emphasis in original]\nBefore his long overdue fall McCarrick, as Bergoglio’s “trusted counselor,” had been instrumental in cementing into place the homosexual-friendly status quo of the American episcopate that oppresses and defrauds the faithful.\nIt was McCarrick, noted Marco Tosatti, who was behind the elevation of Blase Cupich to the key position of Archbishop of Chicago, where Cupich has since promoted the homosexual subversion of Father James Martin.\nAnd Viganò now confirms Tosatti’s allegation: “The appointments of Blase Cupich to Chicago and Joseph W. Tobin to Newark were orchestrated by McCarrick, Maradiaga and Wuerl, united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first, and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two.\nTheir names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.” That is, the normal process was circumvented for these appointments.\nRemnant readers may recall that I spotted Cupich back in 2002, when he was the obscure Bishop of Rapid City, South Dakota, as an example of what was coming in the Novus Ordo: accelerated degeneration.\nAs I wrote back then, with the likes of Cupich in view:\nCupich is the very model of a Novus Ordo bishop.\nHe is the very exemplar of the crisis we must still endure….\nLet the thing die of its own excesses, for as the “little synod” [the 2002 “pedophile summit”] demonstrates, the men who control this establishment will never restore it to anything resembling the vibrant Church that a long line of militant, uncompromising Popes delivered into their hands at Vatican II.\nFor heaven’s sake, the men who govern the Church today require a Vatican summit meeting to agonize over whether serial child molesters should be defrocked.\nFrom the Vatican on down, through deliberate decisions and criminal neglect, the servitors of Vatican II have laid waste to the liturgy, the perennial clarity of Catholic teaching, the Church’s militant opposition to worldly thinking, the traditional formation in seminaries, the religious orders, the missions, the trust of the faithful in their own priests—in short, the very life of the Church—and dare to call it a renewal.\nWe must no longer subsidize the malpractice of the architects of ruin.\nNor must we join the neo-Catholics in their mindless applause when one of these incompetents attempts to repoint a brick or two in the crumbling façade they have erected to obscure the Church of old.\nAs for William (“nighty-night baby!”) Tobin, after McCarrick had arranged for him to become Archbishop of Newark, Tobin, another episcopal booster of Martin’s pro-homosexual propaganda, promptly sponsored a “gay pilgrimage” to his cathedral in Newark.\nAnd it was McCarrick who obtained the cardinal’s hat for his roommate of six years, Kevin Farrell, whom he consecrated a bishop.\nFarrell, yet another promoter of Martin’s homosexual activism, arranged for Martin to “welcome ‘gay’ families” at the “World Meeting of Families” in Dublin from which Bergoglio has just returned.\nFinally, there is the appointment of the “pro-gay” Robert McElroy as Bishop of San Diego, concerning which Viganò reveals: “The appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above, with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio, by Cardinal Parolin: ‘Reserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.’ McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick’s abuses, as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28, 2016.” Like Cupich, Tobin and Farrell, McElroy is an avid promoter of Martin’s homosexual subversion of the Church, calling opposition to Martin symptomatic of a “cancer of vilification [that] is seeping into the institutional life of the church.”\nEmboldened by the certainty that he will face no discipline whatsoever, Martin, now backed by “Cupich, Tobin, Farrell and McElroy,” as Viganò testifies, is urging all the “gay priests” to “come out,” including those ordained since the useless “pedophile summit” presided over by none other than McCarrick as the classic fox in charge of the hen house.\nBut Bergoglio has also lent his own authority to Martin’s effort to mainstream homosexuality in the Church.\nAs Viganò notes, it was Bergoglio who made Martin a “Consultor of the Secretariat for Communications,” even though he is a “well-known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda, chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families…”\n“Father” Martin now confidently declares, sixteen years after the “pedophile summit,” that “The idea of a purge of gay priests is both ridiculous and dangerous.\nAny purge would empty parishes and religious orders of the thousands of priests and bishops who lead healthy lives of service and faithful lives of celibacy.”\nMartin thus revels in smug certitude that the future of the universal Church is in the hands of legions of intrinsically disordered homosexual bishops and priests and their homosexual successors, who will perpetuate an existing worldwide homosexual network, and that there is absolutely nothing we can or should do about it.\nA Worldwide Network of Corruption, Beginning at the Top\nNone of the foregoing is meant to suggest that the homosexual invasion of the Catholic hierarchy is confined to American prelates and priests.\nThe spread of clerical sodomy has not respected national boundaries but rather extends throughout the Church under the eyes of a Vatican apparatus that is itself thoroughly infested with homosexuals.\nThis is thanks in large measure to Bergoglio, who made a flagrantly active homosexual, Monsignor Battista Ricca, “prelate of the gay lobby,” no less than head of his papal household.\nMoreover, it was Bergoglio’s right hand man, Cardinal Maradiaga, who sheltered his friend, Juan José Pineda, auxiliary Bishop of Tegucigalpa, from any discipline over his notorious homosexual liaisons with seminarians in that diocese.\nWhen an apostolic visitation, compelled by mounting public pressure, confirmed the charges against Pineda, he was forced to resign, even as Maradiaga dismissed the incontestable proofs against him as “slander.” Viganò notes that “the only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted, thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere.”\nDespite the fall of his friend Pineda, Maradiaga continues todefend and protect the homosexual corruption of his own seminary, involving incontrovertible evidence of rampant sodomy among the seminarians he refuses to dismiss, rejecting all the evidence as “gossip.” Concerning Maradiaga, who is also mired in financial corruption for which he offers no credible explanation, Viganò provides this withering assessment of the man and his relation to Bergoglio:\nIn a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, [McCarrick] had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States, and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration.\nThis is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal.\nWith these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops….. By now the faithful have well understood Maradiaga’s strategy: insult the victims to save himself, lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power, of mismanagement in the administration of Church property, and of financial disasters even against close friends, as in the case of the Ambassador of Honduras Alejandro Valladares, former Dean of the Diplomatic Corps to the Holy See….\nThe Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops.\nFirst, he insulted the abuse victims.\nThen, only when he was forced by the media, and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful, did he recognize his error and apologize, while stating that he had been misinformed, causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile, but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati.\nOn the very day Archbishop Viganò’s testimony was made public, Sandro Magister summed up the entire state of affairs in the Church universal after decades of unrestricted homosexual migration into the hierarchy, to which Bergoglio has contributed mightily: “From the seminaries, to the clergy, to the bishops, to the cardinals, homosexuals are present at all levels, by the thousand.”\nArchbishop Viganò now provides his own decisive summary of the situation, based on firsthand experience with a now endemic homosexual corruption of the Church:\nJanet Smith, Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, recently wrote: “The problem of clergy abuse cannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops, and even less so by bureaucratic directives.\nThe deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated.” These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.\n[emphasis added]\nDefending the Council by Defending the Homosexual Status Quo\nAt this moment, the entire Novus Ordo regime of novelty is threatened with collapse on account of its homosexual corruption, and voices throughout the Catholic world are now echoing Archbishop Viganò’s call for Bergoglio’s resignation, including Laura Ingraham: “Too little, too late from Pope Francis in Ireland.\nI stand with Archbishop Carlo Vigano.\nTime for the laity to demand a new Shepherd.” Even Michael Voris, in a highly amusing example of leading from behind, has finally abandoned his absurd refusal to criticize this pontificate and now declares with a screaming headline: “Pope Francis Must Resign.”\nNearly three years ago, seeing what was certainly coming on the disastrous course Bergoglio had already clearly established, this newspaper published a petition which states: “We your subjects respectfully petition Your Holiness to change course for the good of the Church and the welfare of souls.\nFailing this, would it not be better for Your Holiness to renounce the Petrine office than to preside over what threatens to be a catastrophic compromise of the Church’s integrity?” Our petition was of course dismissed as “ridiculous” by the neo-Catholic commentariat.\nToday, our ridiculous suggestion is the stuff of mainstream news.\nFrom the neo-Catholic perspective, the events of recent days present a terrifying prospect: the final collapse of the Novus Ordo establishment, an end to the conciliar aggiornamento and a revival of integral Tradition, which growing numbers of young people are seeking.\nHence even before Archbishop Viganò had come forward, commentators like Faggioli were already sounding the neo-Catholic air raid siren.\nFaggioli fretted that “[t]he abuse scandal and delegitimization of the episcopate has created a great power vacuum in the Church” that could be filled by the “neo-traditionalist Catholicism of the younger generations of American Catholics” who “attack American bishops and cardinals close to Pope Francis.” Accordingly, he rushed to the defense of Bergoglio and his corrupt regime against “a radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo-traditionalism sense...”\nFor Faggioli, not only would Bergoglio’s resignation be unthinkable, so also would a purge of the homosexual and pro-homosexual prelates Bergoglio and his Vatican henchmen have systematically enabled.\nThe Pope, he argues, is not “the CEO of the Catholic Church world, and the bishops as its managers whom the Pope can simply fire.” No, Bergoglio cannot “simply fire” bishops.\nExcept whenever he pleases, as we have seen again and again with the conservative bishops and even Cardinals (Burke and Müller) he has sacked because their conservatism offended him or one of his friends, prompting even Crux to ask: “Does Pope Francis have an enemies list?” Then again, Francis even obtained the removal of his own “trusted counselor” McCarrick from the College of Cardinals, albeit only when forced to act due to worldwide condemnation in the media.\nSo, according to Faggioli, the same Pope who sacks conservative bishops and cardinals according to his pleasure and has just removed a cardinal from the College of Cardinals in an unprecedented disciplinary act under fire from the media, is somehow powerless to dismiss Modernist bishops who have created an obscene “gay culture” in the Church and replace them with orthodox, normal heterosexual males.\nFrancis cannot “simply fire” even Cardinal Wuerl, who covered up crimes of homosexual predation by the priests he transferred elsewhere while Archbishop of Pittsburgh, and who authorized payment of $900,000 in hush money to bury sexual abuse claims against a homosexual priest involved in the production of child pornography.\nWuerl, says Faggioli, “faces a complex situation: on the one hand Wuerl was not afraid of clashing with the tribunal over the Apostolic Signatura in the Vatican which wanted to readmit a priest from the Pittsburgh diocese to ministry… while in other cases he seems to have collaborated in covering up some cases… It is a very difficult position also because Wuerl became a symbol… beyond the specific accusations against him, from which he could not publicly defend himself.”\nIn other words, because his situation is “complex” Wuerl, unlike McCarrick, should remain a cardinal and the Archbishop of Washington, DC, thus maintaining a key bulwark against the “neo-traditionalist” threat.\nYet, as the Pennsylvania grand jury report documents, Wuerl assisted McCarrick in the coverup of his crimes and now brazenly lies about it.\nHere too Viganò’s testimony sheds light on the darkness:\n….\nI myself brought up the subject [of McCarrick] with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn’t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it.\nI also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick.\nI immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it.\nIf, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained?\nHis recent statements that he knew nothing about it, even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims, are absolutely laughable.\nThe Cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his Chancellor, Monsignor Antonicelli, to lie as well.\nCardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion.\nFollowing a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters.\nBefore forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written.\nThe Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it.\nHowever, he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters, contrary to what he customarily did.\nI subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years.\nBut the Cardinal knew nothing about it!\nCardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope’s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C.\nIn doing so, he put other seminarians at risk.\n[emphasis in original]\nWhat really concerns Faggioli and those who think like him is not Wuerl and his “complex situation,” which is not complex at all.\nRather, what he views with alarm as an “essential element” of the context in which Wuerl operates is that “scandals are also the opportunity for the neo-traditionalist Catholicism of the younger generations of American Catholics to attack American bishops and cardinals close to Pope Francis….” Better a thousand septuagenarian Wuerls in their lavish sties of corruption, financed by the faithful, than a single, young neo-traditionalist prelate!\nBut what exactly is a neo-traditionalist?\nQuite simply: an orthodox Catholic who has had enough of the homosexual-infested regime of novelty imposed on the Church by the old men of the Council, Bergoglio merely being the latest, the highest placed, and one of the last.\nAs Faggioli puts it: “In the last fifteen years, the American Catholic Church has been traversed by a radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo-traditionalism sense, especially in the younger generations of priests and intellectuals.\nThey interpret the current abuse crisis as fruit of the mistakes of the Council itself and not only of the post-Council…”\nJust as Faggioli fears, many in the up-and-coming generation of Catholic clergy and laity recognize the obvious: that the conciliar texts, for all their prolix repetition of traditional teaching, opened the way to ecclesial disaster.\nBecause in those texts—above all Gaudium et Spes, Dignitatis Humanae, Unitatis Redintegratio, Nostra Aetate and Sacrosanctum Concilium—the Council verbally prostrated itself before “the modern world” and the practitioners of other religions while authorizing Bugnini (Secretary of the liturgical Preparatory Commission that drafted what would become Sacrosanctum Concilium) to begin demolition of the sacred liturgy that was the very foundation Catholic of orthodoxy and orthopraxis.\nTo quote Paul VI, then in the depths of his conciliar delirium at the Council’s close:\nBut one must realize that this council, which exposed itself to human judgment, insisted very much more upon this pleasant side of man, rather than on his unpleasant one.\nIts attitude was very much and deliberately optimistic.\nA wave of affection and admiration flowed from the council over the modern world of humanity….\nInstead of depressing diagnoses, encouraging remedies; instead of direful prognostics, messages of trust issued from the council to the present-day world.\nThe modern world’s values were not only respected but honored, its efforts approved, its aspirations purified and blessed.\n[emphasis added]\nThus did Paul describe the conciliar “opening to the world” through which the world promptly invaded the Church, including large numbers of homosexuals who should never have been admitted to the seminary.\nIn sum, Faggioli is representative of the thinking that requires defense of a homosexualized clergy if only for the reason that tradition-minded Catholics cannot be allowed to take their place: “This neo-traditionalist Catholicism believes that sexual abuses are committed only by homosexual clergy… and that the crisis of abuse can be resolved by a kind of Catholic Jacobinism that should eliminate all bishops and priests minimally engaged in dialogue with modern culture, and replaced by a young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical Middle Ages and the rejection of a Church-world relationship based on a principle of reality.”\nRather than “young clergy marked by personal sanctity,” the neo-Catholic mentality Faggioli exemplifies prefers that homosexual priests and bishops be kept in place in order to continue the “dialogue with modern culture.” It is not the integrity of the Faith that matters but only perpetuation of the post-conciliar regime of novelty.\nAny abandonment of the regime must be viewed as ecclesiastical treason—“Catholic Jacobinism”—if not criminal activity.\nFaggioli would probably be more inclined to civil or criminal prosecution of “Catholic Jacobins” for “hate speech” than Novus Ordo bishops for their complicity in covering up homosexual rapes.\n“Homosexuality in the clergy exists and is a matter that must be addressed,” Faggioli fleetingly acknowledges toward the end of his piece, “but the abuse crisis cannot be resolved by making homosexuals within the Church the scapegoat of a scandal that has ancient roots, well before Vatican Council II.” And how does the Church “address” a massive infestation by homosexual priests and prelates without removing them from authority and ensuring that they cannot promote homosexual successors for generation after generation?\nFaggioli has no answer because what he is really arguing—the final beachhead of the neo-Catholic defense of their disintegrating regime—is that homosexuals in the hierarchy must remain in authority as an indispensable seawall against a “neo-traditionalist” storm surge.\nFaggioli’s argument demonstrates that neo-Catholicism has never been about making the authentic Faith more appealing to a “modern world” founded precisely on a rejection of the Church’s authority.\nIt is not about the Faith at all.\nRather, it is an ideological movement dedicated to the face-saving defense of a catastrophic failure in ecclesial innovation that has corrupted the human element of the Church in practically every department.\nFor people like Faggioli, indeed for the tradition-hating Pope they blindly defend, the one thing to be feared is that more and more faithful will recognize the neo-Catholic polemic for what it is—a fraud—and begin demanding a return of everything the regime of novelty has stolen from the life of the Church.\nThat is exactly what a growing number of Catholics are now doing, as even the secular press recognized less than three months before Bergoglio began his tyrannical reign.\nIn this respect, what the neo-Catholics are defending at bottom is themselves—that is, the reputations they have all staked on their defense of the indefensible against the traditionalists they have arrogantly mocked and marginalized for decades only to see, to their horror, that traditionalism is ever more vindicated as the scandals of the Novus Ordo mount under this reckless Pope to an unsustainable, indeed apocalyptic, level.\nA return to integral Tradition is the threat that Faggioli sees as coming particularly from the young.\nIrony of ironies, he is now reduced to defending what is old and tired and corrupt against a restoration, led largely by a youthful vanguard, of what is ever ancient but ever new.\nFor some, it seems, no price is too great—not even the good of the Church—to avoid the personal ignominy of being seen on the wrong side of history.\nConclusion: The Fatima Connection\nLong before the arrival of Bergoglio in Rome, the successive Vatican Secretaries of State, Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone, were instrumental in advancing the homosexual corruption of the Novus Ordo establishment.\nAs to Bertone and Sodano, Viganò provides further vital testimony:\nNuncio Sambi’s report [on McCarrick’s sexual abuse], with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State.\nMy two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute.\nAs already mentioned, the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals — I cite only the well-known case of Vincenzo de Mauro, who was appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians — and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict….\nCardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information [concerning McCarrick] was communicated to him.\nIn November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick.\nIt is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end.\nHe even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up.\nSodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed.\nBenedict reacted, despite Sodano’s strenuous defense, and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned.\nIt is no coincidence that, as I detail in my book on the Third Secret of Fatima, Sodano and Bertone have also taken the leading role in suppressing the integral Secret and reducing the Message of Fatima in general to a generic prescription for personal piety, stripped of its prophetic and admonitory content regarding the epochal malfeasance and corruption of the upper hierarchy to which they belong.\nConcerning my book, Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Viganò’s predecessor as Nuncio in Washington, whom Viganò’ credits with diligently reporting McCarrick’s crimes to the Vatican and conveying Benedict’s sanctions to McCarrick, made some very revealing comments during an interview with Robert Moynihan, published posthumously six years ago in Inside the Vatican:\nWe were discussing the Third Secret of Fatima, the allegations that the Vatican has not published the entire text of the Third Secret as revealed to Sister Lucia, and the response of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, in a book where Bertone states that there is nothing more to be revealed.\nSambi said, “Excuse me.” He got up, went out of the room, and came back with a book.\n“Here,” he said.\n“Do you know this book?\nYou should read it.” It was Christopher Ferrara's The Secret Still Hidden.\n“Wait,” I said.\n“You are the Pope’s representative in the US, and you are urging me to read a book that questions what the secretary of state wrote?” Sambi replied, “All I am saying is that there are interesting things worth reading in this book.\nAnd in the end, we are all after the truth, aren’t we?\nThe truth is the important thing...”\nThe truth is indeed the important thing.\nAnd the truth about our situation is revealed in that still-hidden part of the Secret to whose contents Pope Benedict alluded during his pilgrimage to Fatima in 2010, identifying elements that do not appear at all in the obscure vision published back in 2000, which Sodano and Bertone tried to pass of as the entirety of the Secret at the same time they were covering up homosexual corruption in high places:\nAs for the new things which we can find in this message today, there is also the fact that attacks on the Pope and the Church come not only from without, but the sufferings of the Church come precisely from within the Church, from the sin existing within the Church.\nThis too is something that we have always known, but today we are seeing it in a really terrifying way: that the greatest persecution of the Church comes not from her enemies without, but arises from sin within the Church, and that the Church thus has a deep need to relearn penance, to accept purification, to learn forgiveness on the one hand, but also the need for justice.\n[emphasis added]\nI believe that Archbishop Viganò’s precious testimony is a sign that Heaven itself is now responding to the “need for justice” in the Church.\nWhether or not justice involves the resignation of the most wayward Pope in Church history, the inevitable season of justice will culminate in the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Church’s restoration.\nThis will be a final victory over the enemies within and their apologists, such as Faggioli, who, in typical neo-Catholic style, imperiously scoffs at the notion of “a young clergy marked by personal

{"prompt":"Cardinal O’Malley will head revived Vatican abuse panel\n\nCardinal Sean O’Malley has been reappointed as the head of a Vatican commission on child sex abuse, as Pope Francis on Saturday revived the panel in the wake of widespread condemnation last month of the pontiff’s defense of a Chilean bishop accused of witnessing and ignoring abuse.\nThe Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors lapsed in December, when its members’ terms expired, prompting concerns that the advisory body could be disbanded.\nIn addition to O’Malley’s return as the panel’s president, Pope Francis named seven returning members and nine new members representing countries around the world, including Brazil, the Netherlands, Ethiopia, and India, according to a statement from the Vatican.\nAdvertisement\nSome members are themselves survivors of abuse, according to the statement, but they were not identified to protect their privacy.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.\nGet what you need today in this early-morning email.\nSign Up Thank you for signing up!\nSign up for more newsletters here\nO’Malley, the archbishop of Boston, said in the statement that the pope had “given much prayerful consideration” to the membership of the panel.\n“The newly appointed members will add to the Commission’s global perspective in the protection of minors and vulnerable adults,” he said.\n“The Holy Father has ensured continuity in the work of our Commission, which is to assist local churches throughout the world in their efforts to safeguard all children, young people, and vulnerable adults from harm.”\nLocal survivors of abuse greeted the announcement warily, hopeful that there could be positive change in the church but saying the panel accomplished little under its first three-year mandate.\n“The objectives of the commission when it was first announced, when it was just getting started.\n.\n.\nwere never fulfilled,” said Phil Saviano, an abuse survivor who founded the New England chapter of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests.\nAdvertisement\nSaviano said the commission is “a good idea,” and added, “I’m not particularly optimistic that much will get accomplished, but a commission is better than no commission.”\nGiven his long experience witnessing the church’s inertia on the issue, Saviano said, he has set his expectations at rock bottom.\n“That’s kind of my attitude now: If I don’t expect the Catholic Church to do anything, then I won’t be too disappointed when they don’t do anything,” he continued.\nJim Scanlan, another survivor, said “the timing of it is too perfect” given the controversy last month surrounding Pope Francis’s remarks that accused victims of a notorious Chilean pedophile priest, the Rev.\nFernando Karadima, of “slander” against Bishop Juan Barros, who the victims say was complicit in a cover up.\nThe pope said he had seen no proof of Barros’s guilt, but the Associated Press reported that O’Malley and other members of the commission had in 2015 hand-delivered to him an eight-page letter from a survivor that graphically detailed his abuse and said Barros and other clergy had witnessed him being fondled but had not intervened.\nAdvertisement\nScanlan said his reaction to hearing that Francis has revived the commission was “hopeful but cynical.” Like Saviano, he said the panel accomplished little in its first incarnation.\n“My expectation is it will probably have the same outcome, because the church is the church, and they do it for appearance, but they’re still going to go by their own rules,” he said.\n“I’ve seen little that has changed.”\nScanlan said Pope Francis has given him hope for progress on some issues in the church, but on sexual abuse, he “continues to be blind to what the church has done.”\nLast month, O’Malley denounced the pope’s controversial defense of the Chilean bishop.\nDespite distancing himself from Pope Francis’s comments, O’Malley said that he has witnessed the pontiff’s genuine compassion for abuse victims.\n“The Pope’s statements that there is no place in the life of the Church for those who would abuse children and that we must adhere to zero tolerance for these crimes are genuine,” O’Malley said, “and they are his commitment.”\nJeremy C.

{"prompt":"“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases\n\nThis report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge\nExperts fear an “explosive increase” in Ebola cases after an outbreak in Congo entered a “new phase” and spread from the countryside to a city.\nThe BBC reports that Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga confirmed a case in Mbandaka, a city of a million people about 130km (80 miles) from the area where the first cases were confirmed earlier this month.\nThe city is a major transportation hub with routes to the capital Kinshasa.\nForty-four people have been infected and 23 people are known to have died.\nSenior World Health Organization (WHO) official Peter Salama said the spread to Mbandaka meant there was the potential for an “explosive increase” in cases.\n“This is a major development in the outbreak,” he told the BBC.\n“We have urban Ebola, which is a very different animal from rural Ebola.\nThe potential for an explosive increase in cases is now there.” Mr Salama, the WHO’s deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said Mbandaka’s location on the Congo river, widely used for transportation, raised the prospect of Ebola spreading to surrounding countries such as Congo-Brazzaville and the Central African Republic as well as downstream to Kinshasa, a city of 10 million people.\n“This puts a whole different lens on this outbreak and gives us increased urgency to move very quickly into Mbandaka to stop this new first sign of transmission,” he said.\nThe BBC adds that the WHO said it was not recommending any trade or travel restrictions either within DR Congo, for example between Mbandaka and Kinshasa, or internationally.\nBut Mr Salama said that 13 countries in the region were boosting border screening measures and said DR Congo itself was increasing exit screening measures.\n“The good news is that the DR Congo population is very used to Ebola outbreaks,” he added.\n“They know to protect themselves by avoiding mass gatherings and mass funerals.\nThey know as well that traditional healers can amplify the outbreak.”\nAs The Daily Mail notes, it is the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in Congo since the disease made its first known appearance near its northern Ebola river in the 1970s.\nEbola is most feared for the internal and external bleeding it can cause in victims owing to damage done to blood vessels.\nThe Mail reports that health workers have recorded confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in three health zones of Congo’s Equateur province, and have identified 432 people who may have had contact with the disease, the WHO said.\nSupplies sent to Congo included more than 300 body bags for safe burials in affected communities.\nThe vaccine will be reserved for people suspected of coming into contact with the disease, as well as health workers.\nThe vaccine requires storage at a temperature between -60 and -80 degrees C, tricky in a country with unreliable electricity.\n>","completion":" Repetition|976|994\nLoaded_Language|62|71\nRepetition|176|194\nRepetition|788|806\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|50|80\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|955|1003."}

{"prompt":"Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam\n\nBritish politician Nigel Farage once helped convince Britons to vote for Brexit and separate from the European Union, but British establishment politicians have done everything they could to sabotage that vote since then.\nNow Farage has apparently decided that if he can’t beat them, he’ll join them — if not on Brexit, then in their stance of denial and appeasement regarding the global jihad threat.’\nAt a recent dinner of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), which he formerly headed, Farage said: “If dealing with Islamic fundamentalism becomes a battle between us and the entire religion, I’ll tell you the result: we’ll lose.\nWe will simply lose….We absolutely have to get that Muslim majority living in many of our towns and cities on our side, more attuned to Western values than some pretty hardline interpretations of the Qur’an.”\nSure.\nNow how does Farage propose to do that?\nHis warning against making the resistance to jihad a “battle between us and the entire religion” is odd.\nNo sane person is saying that the West should go to war with the entire Islamic world.\nThe likeliest interpretation of his statement is that he is saying that we must not speak about how jihadis find justification for their actions in the Qur’an and Sunnah, as that will alienate the “moderates.”\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\n* Dianne Feinstein Maxine Waters Adam Schiff Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand Keith Ellison Cory Booker\nEmail *\nPhone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nBut if we don’t speak about such facts, how will we ever convince Muslims not to follow “hardline interpretations of the Qur’an”?\nAnother problem with Farage’s statement is that it manifests a remarkable ignorance of history.\nWhile he is deeply concerned that British people not begin to think that resisting jihad terror means that they are in a “battle” with the “entire religion” of Islam, he appears unaware of the fact that many Muslims throughout history have considered their entire religion to be at war with the entire non-Muslim world.\nI document this abundantly in my new book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS .\nTo take one of innumerable examples, Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, a fifteenth-century Persian who wrote a biography of the Mongol Muslim warrior Tamerlane, observed that “the Qur’an says the highest dignity man can attain is that of making war in person against the enemies of his religion.\nMuhammad advises the same thing, according to the tradition of the Muslim doctors: wherefore the great Temur always strove to exterminate the infidels, as much to acquire that glory, as to signalise himself by the greatness of his conquests.”\nAfter conquest came dhimmitude, the subjugated status that the Qur’an mandates for “the People of the Book” (primarily Jews and Christians).\nIn the early twelfth century, the Fatimid caliph Al-Amir bi-Ahkamillah issued this edict:\nNow, the prior degradation of the infidels in this world before the life to come—where it is their lot—is considered an act of piety;

most treacherous in regard to all they do; whose whole endeavor in this nether life is useless, though they themselves imagine that they are doing fine work.\nUpon them rests the curse of Allah, of the Angels and of man collectively\nWe must not think that we are at war with the entire religion.\nBut what, Mr. Farage, are we to think about the Muslims who consider themselves and their religion to be at war with us?\nNigel Farage has become just another mainstream hack politician.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|2154|2185\nLoaded_Language|4397|4404\nLoaded_Language|907|911\nLoaded_Language|3370|3381\nLoaded_Language|3835|3855\nLoaded_Language|3846|3855\nLoaded_Language|4223|4259\nLoaded_Language|403|435\nLoaded_Language|3004|3031\nLoaded_Language|3897|3904\nName_Calling,Labeling|4290|4351\nName_Calling,Labeling|4750|4789\nName_Calling,Labeling|446|469\nName_Calling,Labeling|1245|1252\nName_Calling,Labeling|1338|1352\nName_Calling,Labeling|2270|2282\nName_Calling,Labeling|3019|3031\nName_Calling,Labeling|3208|3230\nName_Calling,Labeling|3385|3397\nName_Calling,Labeling|3725|3740\nName_Calling,Labeling|3909|3929\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|568|904\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|3007|3031\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1961|2088\nExaggeration,Minimisation|615|658\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2609|2629\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2777|2796\nExaggeration,Minimisation|4243|4259\nExaggeration,Minimisation|4310|4351\nExaggeration,Minimisation|235|256\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1004|1048\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1114|1143\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2306|2342\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2444|2505\nExaggeration,Minimisation|4353|4404\nExaggeration,Minimisation|4572|4603\nRepetition|1033|1048\nRepetition|2306|2343\nRepetition|2444|2459\nRepetition|4588|4603\nRepetition|698|717\nRepetition|3921|3929\nDoubt|187|289\nDoubt|1058|1143\nDoubt|2091|2505\nDoubt|4726|4789\nThought-terminating_Cliches|330|368\nAppeal_to_Authority|2507|2591\nAppeal_to_Authority|2631|2879\nAppeal_to_Authority|2881|2962\nAppeal_to_Authority|3299|4011\nAppeal_to_Authority|4094|4541\nCausal_Oversimplification|3489|3644\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|4605|4724."}
{"prompt":"Deadly Plague Could MUTATE And Become Untreatable As It Spreads Globally\n\nThe pneumonic plague has already infected 2,000 in Madagascar and killed 143 in the country’s worst outbreak in 50 years.\nBut health officials are now warning the deadly bacteria could mutate and become untreatable as it spreads across the globe.\nCoupled with the high likelihood that this disease could spread globally by an infected traveler getting on a plane to Europe or America, health officials are now warning that the strain of plague which has already killed more than 140 Madagascar could mutate and become untreatable.\nProfessor Paul Hunter has warned that, while it would be rather easy for an advanced country to contain the disease in its current form, he fears that it could evolve into something far more dangerous.\nHunter, who is a disease expert at the University of East Anglia, told the Daily Star: “If it reaches the UK, Europe or the US it would be similar to the Ebola outbreak.\nWe would have a few isolated cases but it shouldn’t spread like it has in Madagascar.” But he had more to add.\n“As with any disease, it’s a real worry that it mutates and become untreatable,” Hunter said.\nSo far, the majority of the recent cases of the black death have the been pneumonic plague, a more deadly form of the bubonic plague which devastated Europe’s population in the 1300s.\nWhile the bubonic plague is spread through the bites of infected fleas, pneumonic plague is spread through the air, usually by coughing.\nAirborne infections are difficult at best to control.\nSymptoms of the plague include a very high fever, coughing (potentially coughing up blood), and headaches.\nTen African nations have already been put on alert that the plague could easily spread to their region of the globe.\nThe plague can be fatal 24-48 hours after infection, but antibiotics will take care of the infection.\nSchools and universities have been closed with a ban issued on public gatherings, such as the tradition of “dancing with the dead” which has been partially blamed for the disease’s spread.\nThe current outbreak is also highly unusual as it has affected urban areas increasing the risk of transmission, according to the World Health Organization.\nWHO has delivered 1.2 million doses of antibiotics to fight the disease while the Red Cross has been training hundreds of volunteers on the island to publicize preventative measures.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|20|26\nAppeal_to_Authority|233|288\nRepetition|7|49\nRepetition|237|288\nRepetition|568|603\nRepetition|742|805\nRepetition|1110|1168\nLoaded_Language|1321|1331\nLoaded_Language|1527|1544\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|31|72\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|765|805\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1689|1714."}

{"prompt":"Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically\n\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump continued bashing Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia investigation, saying cryptically Monday the special counsel is “looking for trouble.”\nTrump alleged in a morning tweet series that the former FBI director is “Disgraced and discredited,” claiming his staff amounts to nothing more than a “group of Angry Democrat Thugs.”\nThat came hours after a Sunday tweet in which he referred to the special counsel team as a “gang.” Both are words with loaded meanings for his conservative political base.\nThe president’s Sunday and Monday attacks on Mueller and his team came after reports that White House Counsel Donald McGahn was interviewed by Mueller and his team for more than one full day.\nTrump contends he signed off on the testimony; George W. Bush-era White House counsel and attorney general Alberto Gonzales, however, told CNN Monday morning that a sitting White House counsel would be required to fully cooperate with a federal investigation because he is a government lawyer, not a president’s personal attorney.\nBut Trump on Monday morning tweeted that McGahn spoke with the special counsel team for “over 30 hours with the White House Councel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency.” (The tweet included a misspelling of “counsel.”)\nThe length of the Mueller-McGahn sessions led Trump to the conclusion the special counsel is “looking for trouble” because they “they know there is no Russian Collusion.”\nBut Mueller reportedly is keenly interested in a widely studied June 2016 Trump Tower meeting arranged by Donald Trump Jr., which included a Russian attorney who promised to hand over negative information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\nThe session also was attended by then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner; the president dictated a misleading statement about it a year later and it remains murky just when he learned about the meeting.\nAs Roll Call has reported, Trump was in the tower at the time of the session with the Russian lawyer.\nThe president also continued to push a line first floated by his attorney, former New York mayor and U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani, tweeting that campaign collusion with Russia would be a “phony crime.” He’s right, there is no specific collusion statute.\nBut legal experts say anyone in Trump’s orbit would be charged with conspiracy, making false statements to federal investigators or obstructing justice.\nAll are federal crimes.\nTrump also continued to cast himself as a victim in the matter, saying when he attempts to “FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt,” his critics “scream Obstruction!”\nMueller also is looking at whether some of Trump’s actions like firing then-FBI Director James B.

{"prompt":"Trump Effect: Islamic Republic Ceases Naval Provocations in Arabian Gulf\n\nYesterday’s State of the Union address issued by Donald Trump represented a refreshing break from the eight years of pusillanimous foreign policies pursued by past administration.\nNowhere was this more evident than in the manner in which Trump described Iran’s repressive regime and attempts by the Iranian people to overthrow it through peaceful protest.\nWhen it comes to Iran’s governing authorities, the Trump administration is under no illusions about the nefarious nature of this fascist theocracy.\n“We are restoring clarity about our adversaries,” Trump stated in a not too subtle jibe at his predecessor who seemed to be in a perpetual state of confusion about who his friends and enemies were.\nTrump also referenced the recent widespread Iranian protests, crushed with extreme ruthlessness by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij auxiliary militia.\n“When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of a corrupt dictatorship,” he stated, “I did not stay silent.\nAmerica stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.”\nBy contrast, Barack Obama and his obsequious acolytes were besotted by the prospect of forging détente with the despotic mullahs of the Islamic Republic.\nHis administration remained largely silent when Iranians took to the streets in 2009 to protest a rigged election.\nSome have speculated that his administration missed out on a prime opportunity for regime change.\nIt was only downhill from there.\nIn a misguided effort to secure Iran’s willingness to sign the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Obama sold everything including the kitchen sink.\nHe tried selling the American people on the naïve notion that there were moderate elements of import in the Iranian government, ignoring the obvious fact that all authority in Iran is vested with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and his IRGC henchmen.\nThe tried and true concept of peace through strength gave way to fecklessness through appeasement.\nRansom payments to the tune of $1.7 billion were transferred to Iran.\nPromising criminal investigations targeting Iran’s chief terror proxy, Hezbollah, were shut down.\nTargeted liquidation operations by our Israeli allies against Iranian Quds Force leaders were foiled after Obama tipped off Tehran on Israel’s intentions.\nIranian material breaches of the JCPOA were all but ignored while Iran’s ballistic missile program was allowed to proceed at full speed despite being in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231.\nObama’s near messianic zealotry in his interactions with the mullahs severely compromised America’s national security and weakened its image on the international stage.\nWorse, it emboldened the mullahs (appeasement tends to do that) who seemed to revel in Obama’s groveling.\nIran’s mischief-making extends far and wide but it is in the Arabian Gulf where friction between the IRGC and the United States Navy remains constant.\nIran regards the Arabian Gulf as its domain and but for the presence of the U.S. 5th Fleet, would have full reign over its waters, which include the strategic Strait of Hormuz.\nIn addition to securing the Gulf, the 5th Fleet serves as a constant reminder to the Iranians of their impotence.\nBut the deterrent effect of the Navy’s 5th Fleet, and for that matter America’s military might, is only as effective as the political leadership that commands it, and Barack Obama as Commander in Chief of the armed forces did little to instill fear or project deterrence.\nOn the contrary, the Iranians correctly viewed him as weak, indecisive and ineffectual.\nOn his watch, American warships patrolling the Gulf were harried by armed IRGC speed boats and larger navy frigates with near impunity.\nAt times Iranian naval vessels closed to within 600 to 150 yards of American warships.\nThe navy termed these near ritualistic, belligerent encounters, “unsafe and unprofessional.”\nIranian arrogance and impudence reached its zenith with the January 12th 2016 seizure of two American riverine command boats and their crews near Farsi Island.\nThe RCBs and crews manning them were returned some 16 hours later but not before the Iranians stole two satellite phone sim cards, likely containing classified information, as well as thousands of pages of information downloaded from laptops, GPS devices and maps used by the sailors.\nIronically, the seizure occurred on the very day that Obama was to give his State of the Union address but predictably, he didn’t think that the seizure of Americans was important enough to note.\nBut according to the Navy, the past five months have witnessed markedly less belligerent conduct from the Iranians, leaving Navy officials baffled by the sudden positive change in attitude.\nIn fact, Iran’s attitude adjustment in the Arabian Gulf is no mystery and stems from the Trump administration’s implementation of a new robust foreign policy vis-à-vis the Islamic Republic.\nSoon after taking office, Trump noted that “Iran [was] playing with fire” and added that he wouldn’t be

there’s a new sheriff in town, one that backs up tough talk with action and doesn’t ask “how high” when they say “jump.” Clearly, the IRGC’s new docile posture in the Arabian Gulf is a direct

{"prompt":"The Cunning CIA\n\nWhatever else might be said about the assassination of President Kennedy, one thing is for sure: The cover-up of this particular U.S. regime-change operation was one of the most ingenious and cunning plots ever designed.\nThis shouldn’t surprise anyone, given that practically from its inception in 1947 the CIA was specializing in the arts of assassination, regime change, and cover-up.\nAs far back as 1953, the CIA published an assassination manual that the CIA succeeded in keeping secret from the American people for more than 40 years.\nIt came to light in 1997 as a result of a Freedom of Information request.\nThat was around the time that the Assassination Records Review Board, which was overseeing the mandatory release of JFK-related assassination records of the CIA and other federal agencies that had been kept secret from the American people since 1963.\nToday, Americans can read the CIA’s assassination manual online.\nTitled “Study of Assassination,” the manual spells out various ways to assassinate people.\nHere is what the manual states in part regarding the use of firearms:\nFirearms are often used in assassination, often very ineffectively….\nPublic figures or guarded officials may be killed with great reliability and some safety if a firing point can be established prior to an official occasion.\nThe propaganda value of this system may be very high.\nTime to buy old US gold coins\nThe manual also makes it clear that the CIA was studying ways to assassinate people without being detected.\nNote the following excerpt:\nFor secret assassination, either simple or chase, the contrived accident is the most effective technique.\nWhen successfully executed, it causes little excitement and is only casually investigated.\nIt would be safe to assume that the CIA continued developing and expanding on the assassination principles enunciated in that early assassination manual.\nThat’s what we would expect from an agency whose specialties included assassination.\nWe can also assume that the CIA continued to refine the ways to avoid detection when assassinating someone.\nThe Kennedy Autopsy Jacob G Hornberger Best Price: $9.85 Buy New $9.95 (as of 03:35 EDT - Details)\nThe CIA published that secret assassination manual as part of its preparations for a U.S. regime-change operation in Guatemala, one that was designed to violently remove the nation’s democratically elected socialist president, Jacobo Arbenz, from office and replace him with an unelected, right-wing, pro-U.S. military general.\nAs part of the Guatemala regime-change operation, the CIA prepared a list of Guatemalan officials to be assassinated.\nWhile the CIA has never revealed the names of the people it targeted for assassination, there is little doubt that Arbenz, the president, was at the top of the list.\nThere is something important to note: Neither Arbenz nor any other Guatemalan official had ever attacked the United States or even threatened to do so.\nSo, why were they targeted for assassination?\nBecause Arbenz had reached out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as John Kennedy would do ten years later.\nThat’s why the CIA targeted Guatemala for regime change and why it targeted Arbenz and other Guatemalan officials for assassination.\nAlthough Arbenz was able to escape the country, the CIA’s regime-change operation was a total success, with Arbenz being replaced by the pro-U.S. Gen. Carlos Castillo Armas, who proceeded to instigate a reign of terror across Guatemala.\nThe Guatemalan operation was brilliant and ingenious.\nThe CIA officials were secretly honored for protecting “national security” by removing President Arbenz from office and replacing him with a pro-U.S. military general.\nTracy Barnes, one of the CIA officials responsible for the operation, was awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the CIA’s second-highest medal.\nThe CIA’s cover-up in the JFK assassination was even more brilliant and ingenious.\nThe doctors at Parkland Hospital stated that President Kennedy had a big exit-sized wound in the back of his head, which implied a shot having been fired from the front.\nAt a press conference immediately after the president died, two treating physicians stated that the other wound — the one in the front of Kennedy’s neck — was an entry wound, which implied that Kennedy had been hit by another shot fired from the front.\nThis necessarily meant that Kennedy had been shot from the front, not the rear, where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was situated.\nKeep in mind something important: After he was arrested, Oswald claimed his innocence.\nBut he also went a step further.\nHe said that he was being framed for the crime.\nThe obvious question arises: Why frame an innocent man who is situated in the rear by killing the president with shots fired from the front?\nWouldn’t it be more logical to either have the shots fired from the rear, where Oswald was, or, alternatively, place Oswald in the front, where the shots were fired?\nThat’s where the brilliance, ingenuity, and cunningness of the cover-up come into play.\nIf Oswald is in the rear and since shots are fired from the front, that could mean only one thing: that Oswald had confederates firing from the front.\nWho would those confederates be?\nThere could be only one answer: communists.\nSoviet and Cuban communists, to be more specific.\nHow would we know this?\nThat’s where Oswald’s trip to Mexico City right before the assassination comes into play.\nRegime Change: The JFK...

Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\nThat’s where the transcript ends according to few secret records of the CIA that were recently released by the National Archives.\nShapira points out, “Several news organizations, including The Washington Post, seized on the truncated file as an example of the government’s continued secrecy about the assassination.” Shapira points out that Helms’ full deposition has been in the public arena since 1994.\n(The year 1994 was during the tenure of the Assassination Records Review Board, the agency charged with securing the mandated release of JFK assassination records from the CIA and other federal agencies.\nThe ARRB Had been formed after Americans had learned of the official secrecy after watching Oliver Stone’s movie JFK, which posited that the JFK assassination was a U.S. regime-change operation, no different in principle from the one the CIA had carried out in Guatemala nine years before.)\nShapira then proceeds to provide the answer that Helms gave, which, as he points out, has been public:\nHELMS: Mr. Belin, this question, and I think you may recall this, was raised at the time and the Agency was never able to find any evidence whatsoever, and we really searched that it had any contact with Lee Harvey Oswald.\nAs far as the FBI was concerned, my recollection is not all that precise.\nI believe that Mr. Hoover testified that he had not been an agent of theirs either.\nHe was certainly not an agent of the CIA.\nHe was certainly never used by the CIA.\nWhether any CIA officer ever talked to him any place or not I don’t know but I certainly felt quite comfortable — I believe Mr. [John] McCone [a previous CIA director] was asked to testify before the Commission on this point.\nI believe he was asked to testify.\nIt was a hot item anyway at the time.\nAnd my recollection is that I informed Mr. McCone that we could find no evidence that Oswald had any connection with the CIA.\nShapira ends his article by suggesting that commentators should do more complete research, maybe even use Google, before they jump to conclusions.\nBut Shapira would be wise to follow his own advice because he himself is guilty of what he accuses others of.\nThat’s because he failed to conclude his article with one great big important point about former CIA Director Richard Helms.\nWhat is that great big important point that Shapira, who, according to his tagline on his article, “enjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities,” left out of his article?\nPerjury.\nHe left out that former CIA Director Richard Helms was a perjurer.\nA liar.\nA CIA official who would tell falsehoods, even under oath, whenever he felt that “national security” required it.\nShapira failed to note that Helms was convicted in a federal district court of lying to Congress under oath about another CIA regime-change operation ten years after the Kennedy assassination in Chile.\nInteresting enough, in the Chile regime-change operation, the CIA and the Pentagon were telling their counterparts in the Chilean national-security establishment that they had a moral duty to violate their nation’s constitution and violently remove their nation’s democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, from office.\nThe reason?\nAllende was reaching out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as Arbenz had done and just as Kennedy had done.\nJFKu2019s War with the... Douglas Horne Check Amazon for Pricing.\nThus, given that Helms was an admitted perjurer and convicted liar, what value does his denial that Oswald was an intelligence agent have?\nIt has no value at all.\nAnd Shapira, who “enjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities” had an ethical duty to point out Helms’ proclivity for lying in his article.\nThe circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly establishes that Oswald was working for U.S. intelligence.\nHow often have you ever heard of a U.S. Marine communist?\nIf Oswald was a genuine communist, why would he have joined the Marines in the 1950s, given that the Marines hated communists and had just helped kill millions of them in the Korean War?\nWhy would a genuine communist want to join an organization in which he could be ordered, on a moment’s notice, to return to Korea or be sent to Vietnam, Laos, China, the Soviet Union, or Europe to kill communists?\nDon’t forget: this is the height of the Cold War!\nAfter Oswald supposedly tried to “defect” to the Soviet Union and promised to give the Russians all the secrets he learned about in the military, why would U.S. officials agree to let him back in the country, and with a communist wife?\nWhy wouldn’t they indict him or at least haul him before a federal grand jury to testify as to what secrets he gave the Russians?\nWhy wouldn’t they harass, abuse, humiliate, persecute, or prosecute him, like they did to Martin Luther King, Dalton Trumbo, John Walker Lindh, Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and other people they have deemed to be communists or traitors?\nHow is it possible that Oswald could learn fluent Russian while serving in the U.S. military without having U.S. military tutors teaching him?\nHow is it possible that a veteran who embarrasses the U.S. Marine Corps by openly proselytizing for communism in New Orleans is able to saunter across the Cold War stage of history, not long after the McCarthy hearings, without nary a care in the world?\nThe answer: Helms lied.\nThere is no reasonable doubt that Oswald was a U.S. intelligence agent, one who was ordered to travel to Mexico City to set the framework for his frame-up.\nBut things obviously went dreadfully wrong in Mexico City, which is why the CIA had to shut down that part of the post-assassination investigation.\nNot surprisingly, the CIA’s Mexico City operations regarding Oswald are among the 98 percent of the records that Trump and the CIA have chosen to continue keeping secret from the American people, on grounds of “national security” of course.\nThus, when Oswald was claiming that he was being framed, there could be only one entity that he could have been thinking about: the CIA, the agency whose officials, as former Washington Post investigative reporter Jefferson Morley has documented, were secretly monitoring his activities in the weeks leading up to the assassination, no doubt to ensure that Oswald had not figured out what was about to happen to him.\nWe can assume that any frame-up by the CIA is going to be good.\nThe operation is going to be carefully planned and executed.\nBut no plan is perfect.\nThings are inevitably going to go wrong.\nThe pieces aren’t going to fit together perfectly.\nThe Mexico City operation is a good example of that.\nThat’s why the CIA has to continue keeping those records secret.\nBut here’s another example, a small but important one: Recall that Oswald supposedly hid the rifle before he headed down the steps from the sixth floor of the school book depository.\nAsk yourself: If someone has just assassinated the president of the United States, is he really going to take the time to hide the rifle?\nWhat good would that do?\nWouldn’t officials conduct a thorough search of the area?\nWouldn’t an assassin instead simply leave the rifle there and get out of there as soon as he could?\nThen why the hidden rifle?\nBecause it’s consistent with a frame-up.\nThe framers had to hide the rifle in advance in a place where no one CIA & JFK: The Secret ... Jefferson Morley Check Amazon for Pricing.\nwould see it during the morning of the assassination, which took place after noon.\nNo matter how good a frame-up was, the CIA knew that it could be detected with an aggressive investigation.\nThat’s where ingenuity and cunning come into play.\nThey had to figure out a way to shut down the investigation so that the frame-up would remain intact.\nThat’s why they had shots fired from the front and placed Oswald in the rear.\nThe idea was that since an investigation would lead to Oswald’s supposed communist confederates in the front, which in turn would lead to nuclear war, the investigation had to be shut down immediately, especially since it was the CIA itself that had started the assassination game by repeatedly attempting, in partnership with the Mafia, to assassinate Castro.\nIt was one of the most brilliant and cunning ruses in history.\nThey get the body out of Parkland by force, in violation of Texas law, and put it in the hands of the military in Maryland, which conducts a secret fraudulent and bogus autopsy.\n(See my book The Kennedy Autopsy.)\nLyndon Johnson telephones Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade on the night of the assassination and orders him to shut down any investigation of a conspiracy because it might lead to nuclear war.\nAs soon as Oswald is assassinated, the FBI orders Wade to turn over all his investigative files to the FBI.\nAt the same time, Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and FBI Head J. Edgar Hoover both write secret memos and reports saying any further investigation must stop immediately.\nLyndon Johnson gets Earl Warren and Sen. Richard Russel to join the Warren Commission by telling them that the assassination could lead to World War III.\nJohnson appoints former CIA Director Allan Dulles, who Kennedy had fired as a result of the CIA’s regime-change operation at the Bay of Pigs, to the Warren Commission, thereby guaranteeing that there will be no investigation of the CIA.\nThen keep all the records secret for decades, when many people won’t care anymore who killed President Kennedy.\nAnd employ Operation Mockingbird-like journalistic assets in the private sector to flood the market with alternative “conspiracy theories” to confound and confuse the public.\nAnd smear anyone who questions the official narrative as a “communist sympathizer” or a “conspiracy theorist.”\nThe CIA’s cunning cover-up in the JFK assassination worked brilliantly.\nThanks to President Trump and the CIA’s decision to continue keeping 98 percent of the CIA’s decades-long secret records secret from the American people, the CIA’s cunning cover-up of the JFK assassination continues to work brilliantly today.\nReprinted with permission from The Future of Freedom Foundation.\nThe Best of Jacob G.

{"prompt":"Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia\n\nNewsCatholic Church, Homosexuality\nAUSTRIA, February 16, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – The Diocese of Linz, Austria, invited homosexual couples to participate in the blessing of couples on St. Valentine's Day.\nThe move comes in the wake of the recent debate over the German bishops' initiative to bless homosexual couples, as well as the controversy over Bishop Andreas Laun's own criticism of it.\nThe diocese’s own media report makes a reference to Amoris Laetitia, as well as to Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent initiative.\nThe official diocesan newspaper, KirchenZeitung, announced on February 9 that in two different parishes in the Diocese of Linz homosexual couples were explicitly invited to receive a Church blessing on St. Valentine's Day.\nAs is explained in the article:\nSt. Valentine is known as the saint of friendship and of love.\nIn many parishes and ecclesial institutions, it is already tradition to offer blessings of couples around the time of his feast day.\nPeople in homosexual relationships are welcome at the blessing ceremonies in Wels-St. Franziskus [Church] and in the Ursulinenkirche.\nPaul Stütz, the author of the article, explains that the blessing of couples “offers an occasion to express love.”\n“The blessing expresses that one is welcomed by one's partner and by God.” At the end of his article, he adds a link to another report about Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent 3 February interview showing his openness to the idea of blessings of homosexual couples in individual cases as decided by a pastor.\nStütz also quotes in the article itself Father Franz Harant, “a pastoral worker in the field of marriage and the family” at the Ursulinenkirche in Linz.\nHarant himself shows himself a supporter of blessings for homosexual couples, and he makes here an explicit reference to Amoris Laetitia.\nAs Stütz reports:\nWe give out that universally available blessing.\nThere, we have nothing to forbid,” says Harant.\nHe sees himself in this in union with Pope Francis who himself says in his magisterial document Amoris Laetitia that “each person, independent of his sexual orientation, is to be respected in his dignity and welcomed with respect.\nAs the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net writes, Harant must be quoting here AL 250.\nIrmgard Lehner, the pastoral assistant of the Wels-St. Franziskus Church, the other of the two parishes that welcome homosexual couples, appreciates this blessing ritual for Valentine's Day, saying it has “an enormous power.” During the ceremony, couples come forward in church and receive a hand on their foreheads and a sign of the cross.\n“We thus stress the high value of relationships,” explains Lehner.\nAs the KirchenZeitung journalist adds: “This offer can be accepted by lovers in all kinds of life situations – also by lesbians and homosexuals.” Lehner, who is herself a theologian, regrets that, so far, no homosexual couple has come for the blessing.\n“Here with us, everybody should feel welcome, just as he or she is.” The pastoral assistant adds that “God is love.\nThere are no restrictions.”\nThe Diocesan Working Group on Pastoral Care for Homosexuals (dahop) is rejoicing about such a welcome from a parish.\nThe group says that it repeatedly receives requests from homosexual couples who wish to “receive a blessing in the frame of a liturgy.”\nThe KirchenZeitung then quotes a commentary, saying:\nIt would be good if a clear sign of openness and invitation would be made by many more pastoral workers [male and female], in order to give the clear signal that love between two persons with equal rights are wished by God and thus already blessed.\nMoreover, the above-quoted Franz Harant himself is the contact person of this Diocesan Working Group – also called “Rainbow Pastoral.” As can be seen on the website of dahop, the Diocese of Linz offers special liturgical services for homosexuals, called “Queer Church Services” (Queer-Gottesdienste) that take place in Harant's own parish.\nIt is not clear whether these church services take place in a form of a Holy Mass.\nSimilar blessings for homosexual couples are currently taking place, or are being considered, also in Gemany, some of them on the diocesan level, some of them on an individual level.\nAs LifeSiteNews reported in January, the Diocese of Limburg is publicly discussing the establishment of a special liturgical rite for the blessing of homosexuals.\nPublicly presented by Johannes zu Eltz, a high-ranking priest of the diocese, his so-called Frankfurt proposal has the public support of the local bishop, Georg Bätzing.\nAdditionally, the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net reports that there are two Catholics priests in two different German dioceses who publicly state now to have given many blessings to homosexual couples.\nFather Christoph Simonsen (Diocese of Aachen) says that he has blessed 50 couples in the last fifteen years; Father Siegfried Modenbach (Archdiocese of Paderborn) has blessed two homosexual couples in the last years.\nHe also conducts church services for homosexuals.\nKath.net subsequently contacted both Dioceses and requested information about these two priests.\nAs an answer, they were told that the Diocese intends to talk with the concerned priests, but that this matter needs to be addressed among the German bishops in general, such as in the German Bishops' Conference.\nThis moral turmoil in German dioceses has provoked concern and criticism among Catholics.\nMathias von Gersdorff, German pro-life activist and book author, states on his own blog, the upcoming Spring Assembly of the German Bishops' Conference will become crucial in this matter.\nAs he sees it, “the bishops of Germany who will meet next week for the Spring Assembly of the Bishops' Conference find themselves in a complicated situation,” where they will have to show their colors.\nThey will either be in favor of the Catholic Church's teaching on sexuality and marriage and forbid such blessings, or “essentially accept them,” at least by “saying nothing.”\nHe concludes:\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_Authority|1616|1905\nAppeal_to_Authority|2022|2251\nLoaded_Language|2537|2564."}
{"prompt":"SPECIAL REPORT: Pope Francis Accused of Inaction in Notorious Sex Abuse Cases\n\nThe incident was brief: on the Thursday of the pope’s week-long South American trip, in response to an impromptu question tossed out by a Chilean reporter, the pope responded in what one reporter described as a “snippy tone”: “The day I see proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk.\nThere is not a single piece of evidence against him.\nIt is all calumny.\nIs that clear?”\nThis month has been quite a spectacle, even for this pontificate; an apparently unending stream of outrages and embarrassments, with the pope and his Vatican media support jumping from one scandal to the next.\nBut among secular reporters the sex abuse issue trumps all others and the fallout continues to blaze down on the Bergoglian pontificate in response to his amazing accusation earlier this month that victims of sexual abuse by clergy were engaging in “calumny,” in their accusations against a Chilean bishop, Juan de la Cruz Barros Madrid.\nIt seems the shine is coming off the papal penny among leftist secular journalists, his natural constituency.\nWriting for the Boston Globe, the paper that first broke the clerical sex abuse scandals all the way back in 2001, Kevin Cullen wrote, “Let the record show that the promise of Pope Francis died in Santiago, Chile, on Jan. 18, in the year of our Lord 2018… he has revealed himself like no one else could.”\nBut it gets worse than this.\nWhen a “leftist” pope pressing a secularist agenda on the Church starts to lose the support of Michael Sean Winters and the National Catholic Reporter, he must know he’s in trouble.\nThough he’s “sticking with Francis” for now, Winters wrote, “I wish I knew what it was about Pope Francis that makes him fail to grasp the situation with Bishop Barros, the pain caused to the victims and the damage done to the church.\nI am gobsmacked that the pope twice declined to accept the bishop’s resignation.”\nOn January 23rd, an unsigned NCR editorial opined, “Within the space of four days, Pope Francis twice slandered abuse survivors.”\n“These remarks are at the least shameful.\nAt the most, they suggest that Francis now could be complicit in the cover-up.\nThe script is all too familiar: Discredit the survivors’ testimony, support the prelate in question, and bank on public attention moving on to something else.\n“The insistence with which Francis defends Barros is mystifying.\nThree separate journalists on the papal flight gave the pope opportunity to say why exactly he believed the bishop instead of the survivors accusing him.\nThe second journalist to ask Francis about Barros on the flight was a Chilean woman.\nAs she spoke to the pope, her voice cracked with nervousness at questioning the church’s top leader.\nShe asked: ‘Why are not the victims’ testimonies proof for you?\nWhy do you not believe them?’ The pope gave no satisfying answer, only repeating a claim of ‘no evidence’ against the bishop.”\nIndeed, it was understood, as the Washington Post said, that Francis’ trip to Latin America – dogged by protests over Barros both in person at the pope’s appearances and in the press – was in part intended as “an apology tour” to abuse survivors.\nWhich is why his accusation of calumny against those same victims the next day came as such a shock to observers unused to Bergoglio’s ability to turn on a dime.\nAll was going as planned.\nOn Wednesday, January 17, the pope met as scheduled with selected survivors of sexual abuse by priests.\nHe made all the right noises, talking about his “pain and shame,” and reportedly even crying, at what happened.\n“I know the pain of these cases of child abuse and I am following how much is needed to overcome this serious and painful evil,” he said.\n24 hours later he was calling them liars.\nJames Hamilton, 49 and now a doctor, was one of the Barros accusers.\nHe told the BBC at a press conference, “What the Pope has done today is offensive and painful, and not only against us, but against everyone seeking to end the abuses.” The lead voice of the victims in Chile, Juan Carlos Cruz, tweeting to one of Francis’s leading apologists, Austen Ivereigh, said, “Does he need a photo, a selfie, as proof?\nSorry Austen, we didn’t think of it as we were being abused and Juan Barros watching.”\nAlthough the issue came to the attention of a much broader audience during the most recent papal trip, the outcry has been ongoing since his appointment to the southern Chilean diocese of Osorno in 2015.\nBarros was a student protégée of the charismatic homosexual\/pederast predator Fernando Karadima, and went on to be ordained in 1984, made bishop in 1995 and appointed as bishop of the armed forces.\nBarros claimed in court that the first he knew of Karadima’s offenses was on a Chilean television programme in 2010.\nThis is refuted by Karadima’s victims – deemed credible both by the secular courts and the Vatican tribunal – who testified that he personally witnessed the abuse at Sacred Heart of Jesus church in Santiago.\nLast Thursday, however, was not the first time Francis, confronted unexpectedly in public over the Barros question, has responded testily and with insults.\nIn 2015 the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano published a video of him scolding two women who spoke with him in St. Peter’s Piazza, asking that he reconsider the appointment, citing the “suffering” of the Church in Chile over the issue.\nThe pope told the women, “The Church has lost its freedom, letting its head fill with politicians and accusing a bishop without having any proof, after twenty years of service, so think with your head.” He warned them not to allow themselves to be led by “leftists who have set up this thing.”\n“The only charge against this bishop has been discredited by the Court of Justice, so please do not lose your serenity, you suffer, but because you are foolish...I am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes, but in this case there is not even a proof.”\nThe insults were not forgotten.\nAmong the signs held by protesters in Chile last week were those reading, “Ni zurdos, ni tontos,” (Neither lefties nor stupid).\nThe jab certainly wasn’t lost on Francis, since the signs were being held by protesters the full length of his auto route to Santiago from the airport.\nOne of the protesters told the BBC, “He doesn’t even know us, so how can he accuse us of being such things?\nHe thinks we are politically motivated even though we come from different parishes in Osorno and are doing this because we are against priests being allowed to abuse children.”\nApparently His Holiness was informed that the “calumny” comment had caused some blow-back because a couple of days later we got something touted – though somewhat skeptically – as a “contrite” papal apology.\nThis also followed an astonishing public rebuke of the pope by Sean Cardinal O’Malley – a member of the C9 council of cardinals and the former head of the pope’s sex abuse commission – who said, “It is understandable that Pope Francis’ statements yesterday in Santiago, Chile were a source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse by clergy or any other perpetrator.”\n“Pope Francis fully recognizes the egregious failures of the Church and its clergy who abused children and the devastating impact those crimes have had on survivors and their loved ones,” O’Malley said.\nOf course, Francis being Francis the apology was banked around with assertions of how right he was.\n“I have to ask forgiveness because the word ‘proof’ wounded,” he said.\n“It wounded many people who were abused…I ask them for forgiveness because I wounded them without realizing it, but it was an unintended wound.\nAnd this horrified me a lot, because I had received them.”\n“And I know how much they suffer, to feel that the Pope says in their face ‘bring me a letter, a proof.’ It’s a slap.\nAnd I agree that my expression was not apt, because I didn’t think.”\nHe doubled down, saying, “I have not heard any victim of Barros.\nThey did not come, they did not show themselves, they did not give evidence in court.\nIt’s all in the air.\nIt is true that Barros was in Karadima’s group of young people.\nBut let us be clear: if you accuse someone without evidence with pertinacity, that is calumny.”\n“This is what I can say with sincerity.\nBarros will remain there if I don’t find a way to condemn him.\nI cannot condemn him if I don’t have – I don’t say proof – but evidence.\nAnd there are many ways to get evidence.\nIs that clear?”\nThis “contrite” papal apology didn’t fly well even with the regular news reporters.\nPhilip Pullela, a reporter on the plane for Reuters, described it as “an extremely rare act of self-criticism,” for the “unusually contrite” Bergoglio, and noted that, “While the pope has vowed ‘zero tolerance’ for sexual abuse, his efforts have sputtered.”\nIndeed, Francis claim that he met with and heard the “pain” of the victims is untrue in the specific case in hand.\nCBS News reports that though the Osorno group had tried to obtain a meeting during the trip they were refused.\nGreg Burke, the pope’s press officer, confirmed that “no papal meetings were planned with the Osorno group, which had formally requested to meet with the pope in July but were told by Vatican organizers that his schedule was already final, some six months before the trip.”\nWho is Barros?\nSome may remember a video that made the internet rounds of an uproar in a Chilean cathedral at the installation ceremony of a bishop.\nAt the time it didn’t draw much attention from the English language press – mostly at that time distracted by the ongoing battle of the notorious Kasper Proposal and the oncoming Synods.\nBut despite the pope’s claim, the charges against Barros are serious and have been deemed credible by a judge.\nHe is accused of having covered up sexual abuse, including destroying evidence, committed by Karadima in the ‘80s and ‘90s.\nIn fact – and this point has tended to get glossed over in the press – Barros is accused by the victims of having been in the room, watching at the time, and of engaging in sexual activity with Karadima.\nThis is not, therefore, merely a matter of a bishop or colleague discovering the abuse after the fact, but of being a voyeuristic participant.\nJuan Carlos Cruz, told the press in 2015 that he and another boy – both in their teens at the time – “would lie down on the priest’s [Karadima’s] bed, one resting his head at the man’s shoulder, another sitting near his feet.\nThe priest would kiss the boys and grope them, he said, all while the Rev.\nJuan Barros watched.” Cruz, now a 51-year-old “gay” journalist, told The Associated Press, “Barros was there, and he saw it all.”\nA Vatican investigation found Karadima guilty in 2011 and sentenced him to a life of seclusion in a monastery for “penitence and prayer.” Note that date; 2011 was when the processes for investigating and trying priest-abusers, put in place by the former Cardinal Ratzinger, were still in effect, and while he was still sitting on the Petrine throne.\nThings are a bit different now.\nNeither was the complaint against Barros without the support of responsible people.\nThe media reported that over 1,300 Catholic faithful in Osorno, including 30 priests of the diocese and 51 members of Parliament, wrote to the pope asking him to rescind the appointment – none of which received any response.\nFr.\nPeter Kleigel, a priest of Osorno, told Associated Press, “We’re convinced that this appointment is not correct because, following canon law, a bishop must be well-regarded.\nWe need a bishop who’s credible.”\nThe problem with getting the news out about Karadima, as in most of these cases, was the bishop, in this case Cardinal Francisco Javier Errázuriz of Santiago, who after the Conclave of 2013 was appointed a member of Pope Francis’s C9 inner council.\nIt was certainly never a secret that Errázuriz was a close, like-minded friend and collaborator of then-Cardinal Bergoglio, the kingpin of South American Catholicism.\nAllegations against Karadima – that went back to 1962 – had certainly been reported to Church authorities well before a Chilean news agency revealed the case in 2010, but were ignored by Errázuriz.\nEven the National Catholic Reporter in 2014 pointed to the cover up and the relationship between the new pope and the accused cardinals,\n“Hamilton had applied for a marriage annulment, after telling his wife of a long psychosexual entanglement with Karadima that began when he was 17 in El Bosque.\nHis wife confided in a priest, who told Errázuriz in 2006.\nWhen a canon lawyer and several priests close to the cardinal suggested that Hamilton not mention Karadima, he pressed on with his request in order to force the issue of punishment for the priest while having his marriage annulled.\nAgain, Errázuriz refused to take action against Karadima.”\nThe pope’s claim that there is “no evidence” flies in the face of the ruling of the civil judge in the Karadima case – a fact that ought to be of paramount consideration under the Vatican’s own rules for determining credibility in such cases.\nWhile Judge Jessica Gonzalez was forced to drop criminal charges because the statute of limitations had expired, she affirmed that testimony by Cruz and other victims was credible.\nAfter a full year of investigation, Gonzalez called their claims “truthful and reliable”.\nVictims said that a letter written to Church authorities complaining of Karadima’s abuse in 1982 was intercepted and destroyed by Barros, who was serving at the time as secretary to Cardinal Francisco Fresno, Errázuriz’s successor and collaborator.\nAs for Barros’s general credibility as a Catholic bishop, the witness of the victims is damning.\nIn a letter to Bishop Ivo Scapolo, papal nuncio to Chile, that Cruz gave to the Associated Press, he said he witnessed Karadima and Barros in an intimate relationship.\n“I saw Karadima and Juan Barros kissing and touching each other.\nThe groping generally came from Karadima touching Barros’ genitals”.\nBarros has never denied having had a close friendship with Karadima.\nHamilton confirmed this saying, “I saw how Barros watched it all.”\nAnd the matter didn’t end in 2010.\nEmails published in Chile in 2015 showed that Cardinal Errázuriz also blocked the appointment of Juan Carlos Cruz from the new child protection commission – a group plagued by such scandals and eventually ignored to death by Francis.\nWhich brings us to Francis Bergoglio’s own record in this area.\nThe pope claimed “I am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes,” but this claim is not supported by the reality.\nIndeed, it has been pointed out that Francis has gone to considerable lengths to dismantle the efforts of his predecessor at “safeguarding” young people, punishing abusers and removing bishops who cover it up.\nIn the case of Barros, the Associated Press obtained a confidential letter from Pope Francis dated 2015 that “reveals the [Chilean] bishops’ concern about Francis naming a Karadima protégé, Bishop Juan Barros.” Just days before the pope’s “calumny” comment, January 11, AP reported that Francis had full knowledge of the controversy he risked in appointing Barros to Osorno.\n“[H]is ambassador in Chile had tried to find a way to contain the damage well before the case made headlines.”\nThe letter, addressed to the executive committee of the Chilean bishops’ conference, said, “Thank you for having openly demonstrated the concern that you have about the appointment of Monsignor Juan Barros.\nI understand what you’re telling me and I’m aware that the situation of the church in Chile is difficult due to the trials you’ve had to undergo.” The letter said that in 2014 the nuncio, Archbishop Scapolo, had asked Barros to resign as bishop of the armed forces and had “encouraged him to take a sabbatical year before assuming any other pastoral responsibility as a bishop.”\nThere can also be little doubt the new pope was fully aware of the record of his close friend Cardinal Errázuriz in ignoring complaints of Karadima’s victims when he appointed him to the C9 council.\nAnd even if he didn’t then, he certainly knows now, and yet Errazuriz continues in that advisory role.\nFrancis further appointed Cardinal Errázuriz to serve as his Special Envoy to World Apostolic Congress Of Mercy III meeting in Bogotá, Colombia in June 2014.\nSince 2001, Cardinal Ratzinger and later as Pope Benedict installed effective procedural reforms on clerical sexual abuse; Francis in his short five years has all but completely dismantled or reversed those changes.\nAmong the earliest indications Catholics had that the new pope had no intention of getting to the bottom of the priest-abuser problem was his appointment of the notorious homosexual, Monsignor Battista Ricca, as head of the Vatican Bank and the man in charge of his own residence, the Casa Santa Martha.\nIt is often forgotten that Bergoglio’s notorious comment “who am I to judge” was in response to a question on a plane-presser about Ricca, and was followed with a similar claim from Francis about there having been no proof of his misbehaviour.\nAs the pseudonymous Marcantonio Colonna wrote in the book, “The Dictator Pope,” “In fact his patronage of Monsignor Ricca fits the pattern which was well established when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires, whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb.”\nBut even before this was the sinister appearance of Godfried Cardinal Danneels on the loggia on the night of Francis’s election to the papacy.\nDanneels’s prominence in the Bergoglian pontificate continues to be the most prominent indicator of the pope’s deprioritising of clerical sexual abuse.\nThe former head of the Brussels archdiocese was a leading figure in the so-called St. Gallen Group, which he himself described as a “mafia,” who had worked against the election of Joseph Ratzinger in 2005 and to elect Bergoglio in 2013.\nAt the end of a long career as Europe’s leading “liberal” Catholic prelate, Danneels came under a cloud of scandal when he was accused of having covered for a protégé bishop who admitted to having sexually abused his own minor nephew.\nIn 2010 the publication of an audio recording determined undeniably that Danneels had told the victim to keep quiet and not cause trouble for the soon-to-retire Bishop Roger Vangheluwe of Bruges.\nThe cardinal even went so far as to suggest that the victim should “ask forgiveness” for his own role in the scandal.\nBefore the recordings were released, Danneels had also denied all knowledge of sexual abuse by clergy or cover-ups.\nIn the book, Colonna asks the question, “What happened to ‘Zero Tolerance’ for clerical sexual offenders?” He wrote that data presented by the Vatican the UN Human Rights Commission in January 2014 showed that Benedict XVI “had defrocked or suspended more than 800 priests for past sexual abuse between 2009 and 2012,” including the notorious Fr.\nMaciel Degollado, founder of the Legionaries of Christ.\nCrucially, it was Ratzinger who moved the competence for sex abuse cases from the Congregation for Bishops to Doctrine of the Faith, with powers to suspend and punish offenders.\nHis reforms specifically included bishops who had refused to act against priest-abusers.\nA senior member of the Vatican’s diplomatic corps, Archbishop Miguel Maury Buendia, confirmed this, saying, “This Pope has removed two or three bishops per month throughout the world...\nThere have been two or three instances in which they said no, and so the Pope simply removed them.”\nThese reforms – and removals – have ceased entirely under Francis.\nDespite his claims that he punishes the guilty, it was in fact Francis who reversed the previous, Benedict-era sentence against the notorious Italian priest-pederast Mario Inzoli at the request of the now-equally notorious Cardinal Coccopalmerio.\nInzoli was found guilty in 2012 by an ecclesiastical court of abusing boys as young as twelve and suspended.\nInzoli had even abused boys in the confessional, convincing them that the abuse was approved by God.\nFollowing an appeal by Coccopalmerio, Francis reduced the priest’s penalty to a “lifetime of prayer,” with permission to say Mass privately, and a promise to stay away from children.\nThe uproar over this caused the Italian prosecutors to reopen the case against the priest, and eventually Inzoli went to prison and was laicized.\nAs for Ratzinger\/Benedict’s procedural reforms, rumours continue to circulate that the pope intends to reverse them as well, placing competence back into the hands of the same dicastery that held it when the scandals broke in 2001.\nThis has been denied by Greg Burke, but given Francis’s usual methods, it’s anyone’s guess who in reality is actually dealing with these cases, if anyone.\nA tribunal of bishops, requested by his own sex abuse commission, was ignored and then Francis summarily removed two of the CDF staffers in charge of handling such cases, famously refusing to give any reasons to CDF prefect Cardinal Müller who was soon to be dismissed.\nIn fact, the chaos and lack of commitment on the issue has come under harsh criticism from at least one member of the pope’s now-defunct sex abuse commission, a loudly trumpeted part of Bergoglio’s early scheme of reform.\nMarie Collins, an Irish abuse survivor, was appointed in 2014 to the new Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors.\nShe resigned in 2017, citing “Vatican officials’ reluctance to cooperate with its work to protect children.” Collins released a damning statement, indicating that the commission had never seriously intended to change or reform anything.\nShe said none of the commission’s recommendations had been implemented.\n“The reluctance of some in the Vatican Curia to implement recommendations or cooperate with the work of a commission when the purpose is to improve the safety of children and vulnerable adults around the world is unacceptable,” Collins wrote.\nAs of December last year, the commission has been allowed to lapse, and no longer functions, though it has not been definitively dissolved.\nThe terms of office of its members expired December 17th.\nThis week Collins tweeted her question for Pope Francis on the Chilean situation: “Why does the Pope not believe these three men?\nThey have been consistent over years in what they say.\nWhen asked why he believes his fellow cleric and not the survivors he can give no good reason.”\nWhy indeed.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Facebook Lifts Frontpage Editor Jamie Glazov’s 9\/11 Ban\n\n[Editors' note: To best understand why Facebook would ban Jamie Glazov on 9\/11 in the first place, pre-order Jamie's new book, Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us: HERE.\nThe book illustrates how the Jihadist Psychopath has, with the help of the Left, successfully built his totalitarian plantation in the West -- on which the political and cultural establishment is now enslaved and dutifully following his orders.\nJamie outlines the frameworks of this tyrannical plantation and how those who are trapped on it, and yearn for freedom, can best escape.]\nFrontpage editors are happy to announce our free speech victory: Facebook has lifted Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov's 30-day ban on Facebook, apologizing and saying that the block was a “mistake”.\nWe have no doubt, of course, that no “mistake” had actually occurred in this matter and that the ban has only been lifted because of the publicity that we engaged in -- and received.\nWhile it is a positive development that Facebook has lifted the ban on Jamie (for now), this story is crucial to amplify now more than ever, seeing that Facebook, and all of leftist-run social media, is, at this moment, clearly accelerating its totalitarian attack on the free speech of conservatives.\n(See Jamie's video on this whole surreal affair HERE).\nA brief recap of Jamie's story: on Sept. 11, the 17th Anniversary of the 9\/11 terror strike, Facebook's Unholy Alliance masters informed Jamie that he was suspended from Facebook for 30 days due to his posting of his article, 9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad, which Facebook informed him violated their \"community standards.\"\nThis suggested, of course, that giving advice on how to prevent another 9\/11, and all other Jihadist attacks against America, is now against Facebook’s ‘community standards’.\n(Read the whole story HERE.)\nFrontpage and Jamie immediately publicized this tyrannical behavior of Facebook.\nThen, yesterday, on Sept. 13, Facebook notified Jamie that it had made a mistake and that it was lifting his block.\nIt goes without saying that this retraction and surrender by Facebook occurred only because of the wide publicity that Jamie's banning had received.\nAnd we are immensely grateful for all the massive support that was given to us across the Internet, including especially from Breitbart, PJMedia, WorldNetDaily and Thomas Lifson at American Thinker.\nLeading brave conservative figures such as Michelle Malkin and Laura Loomer also stood up for Jamie, tweeting about his ban -- and to them we send our heartfelt appreciation.\nJamie is, of course, no stranger to social media censorship -- especially of the insane variety.\nThe Counter Jihad Coalition's (CJC) Facebook page, which Jamie helped run with CJC President Steve Amundson, was removed a few years ago with absolutely no explanation.\nThe CJC is a human rights and pro-national security group that is dedicated to protecting America and the West from Jihad -- and Muslim and non-Muslim people from Sharia oppression.\nThe question remains: why would Facebook remove such a page, let alone in such a fascistic manner -- and never explain why?\nIn April earlier this year, Jamie was suspended from Facebook for posting screenshots of a Muslim's threat to him on the platform.\nThen, in May, his Twitter account was temporarily suspended and he was forced to delete tweets he posted which directly quoted Islamic religious texts.\nHis account was suspended for violating Twitter’s rules relating to “hateful conduct.” It is \"hateful conduct\", apparently, to reference what Islamic texts themselves say.\nIndeed, Frontpage's editor had simply referred to Sahih Bukhari’s texts discussing Mohammed’s marriage to Aisha when she was six years old (7.62.88) and to Qur'anic Suras that mandate the Hijab for women (24:31; 33:59) and sanction sexual slavery (4:3; 33:50).\nOne thing we know for sure is that, despite this lifting of Jamie’s ban, Facebook and the leftist totalitarians in other social media venues and in the culture at large will continue their unrelenting effort to suffocate dissent and conservative voices.\nOn Facebook, many brave conservative truth-tellers continue to be censored in myriad ways; these individuals include Anni Cyrus, Bosch Fawstin, Mark Lutchman and, of course, Diamond & Silk.\nThe case of #WalkAway leader Brandon Straka is especially disturbing: he was recently banned by Facebook for the crime of announcing that he would be interviewed by Alex Jones.\nPrager U has had its videos mysteriously disappear off of Facebook and then, only after vociferous protest, re-appear.\nFacebook is, of course, just one terrain of this leftist brownshirt-style assault on free speech.\nEveryone knows by now, for instance, what has happened, in the most Orwellian sense, to Alex Jones and InfoWars on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\nLeading scholar of Islam and JihadWatch.org Director Robert Spencer, meanwhile, is not just a target at Facebook, where his referrals are down 90% from what they once were;

33:59) and sanction sexual slavery (4:3; 33:50).\nFacebook also refused to respond to Glazov’s inquiry about “what it is specifically that violates Facebook’s ‘community standards’ when a person gives advice on how to best defend American lives from jihad.”\nGlazov has written about the subject in previous books, including “High Noon for America: The Coming Showdown” and “United in Hate.”\nIn his “9 Steps” article, he points out that the Obama administration was “cooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA.”\nThe government needs, he said, to “implement a concrete ‘countering-jihad’ strategy.”\nAnd he said it needs to affirm “Shariah’s assault on the U.S. Constitution as seditious.”\nA last key point, the said, is to ridicule the enemy.\nRidicule is a vicious and potent weapon.\nThere is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture’s sphere of comedy, especially in Hollywood and our media, with regard to the myriad ingredients of Shariah and jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches.\nBill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives’ eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit.\nAmerican comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher’s footsteps and Americans need to encourage and equip them to do so – and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|1559|1626\nLoaded_Language|1733|1788\nCausal_Oversimplification|2238|2379\nLoaded_Language|4240|4258\nExaggeration,Minimisation|4441|4499\nFlag-Waving|3649|3693\nName_Calling,Labeling|4053|4079\nName_Calling,Labeling|30|44\nName_Calling,Labeling|218|237\nLoaded_Language|249|285\nName_Calling,Labeling|322|341\nName_Calling,Labeling|369|392\nLoaded_Language|430|473\nName_Calling,Labeling|513|534\nLoaded_Language|714|729\nName_Calling,Labeling|862|876\nRepetition|862|868\nName_Calling,Labeling|926|945\nLoaded_Language|957|993\nName_Calling,Labeling|1459|1482\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|1611|1626\nName_Calling,Labeling|1670|1693\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2091|2136\nName_Calling,Labeling|2303|2319\nName_Calling,Labeling|2443|2459\nLoaded_Language|2487|2497\nName_Calling,Labeling|2501|2519\nCausal_Oversimplification|2462|2574\nLoaded_Language|2714|2758\nLoaded_Language|2775|2795\nName_Calling,Labeling|2799|2819\nCausal_Oversimplification|2822|2915\nName_Calling,Labeling|2857|2915\nLoaded_Language|3041|3051\nName_Calling,Labeling|3121|3141\nName_Calling,Labeling|3150|3165\nLoaded_Language|4278|4299\nLoaded_Language|4803|4825\nLoaded_Language|4847|4855\nName_Calling,Labeling|4890|4929\nLoaded_Language|2095|2107\nAppeal_to_Authority|3996|4079\nAppeal_to_Authority|4082|4169."}
{"prompt":"Pope Francis Denounces “Murderous Indifference” To Persecution Of Christians, Of Which He Is A Chief Architect\n\nAssociated Press reported that the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and other Orthodox Patriarchs met with Pope Francis on Saturday, and that the Pope had some strong words to say about the persecution of Christians in the Middle East.\nThe Pope couldn’t resist an anti-Semitic shot at Israeli “occupation,” but he also seemed to denounce Islamic jihad activity, saying: “So many conflicts have been stoked too by forms of fundamentalism and fanaticism that, under the guise of religion, have profaned God’s name – which is peace – and persecuted age-old neighbors.” He decried the “thirst for profit that surreptitiously exploits oil and gas fields without regard for our common home, with no scruples about the fact that the energy market now dictates the law of coexistence among peoples!”\nThe Pope lamented the fact that in recent years the Middle East has been “covered by dark clouds of war, violence and destruction, instances of occupation and varieties of fundamentalism, forced migration and neglect.” And he deplored the fact that “all this has taken place amid the complicit silence of many.\nThe Middle East has become a land of people who leave their own lands behind.” He cried: “Indifference kills, and we desire to lift up our voices in opposition to this murderous indifference.\nFor the Middle East today is weeping, suffering and silent as others trample upon those lands in search of power or riches.”\nThese are odd statements coming from Pope Francis, a world-class Islamopanderer; notice that he said nothing about who was doing the persecuting, and implied that it was the fault of powers outside the Middle East.\nThe Catholic Church as a whole has committed itself to Islamopandering, such that it is largely silent about the Muslim persecution of Christians that has taken place in the Middle East.\nWhy?\nThe Catholic Church is following Pope Francis’ lead, and Francis has said: “Christian terrorism does not exist, Jewish terrorism does not exist, and Muslim terrorism does not exist.\nThey do not exist.” And he has also said: “Authentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every form of violence.”\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\n* Yes, he will be confirmed.\nNo, he will not be confirmed.\nEmail *\nComments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nThis has had a terrible influence upon the Catholic Church, and aids and abets the Western political and media elites in their determination to cover up the Muslim persecution of Christians.\nJean-Clément Jeanbart, the Melkite Greek Catholic Archbishop of Aleppo, gave an interview to a French reporter in which he was highly critical of the mainstream media and even of his fellow bishops for ignoring the Muslim persecution of Middle Eastern Christians.\n“The European media,” he charged, “have not ceased to suppress the daily news of those who are suffering in Syria and they have even justified what is happening in our country by using information without taking the trouble to verify it.” And as for his brother bishops in France, “the conference of French bishops should have trusted us, it would have been better informed.\nWhy are your bishops silent on a threat that is yours today as well?\nBecause the bishops are like you, raised in political correctness.\nBut Jesus was never politically correct, he was politically just!”\nArchbishop Jeanbart was not the first to say this.\n“Why, we ask the western world, why not raise one’s voice over so much ferocity and injustice?” asked Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, the head of the Italian Bishops Conference (CEI).\nSyriac Catholic Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem Joseph III Younan himself has in the past appealed to the West“not to forget the Christians in the Middle East.” The former Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarch Gregory III has also said: “I do not understand why the world does not raise its voice against such acts of brutality.”\nBut Gregory III should have understood, since he was a major part of the problem.\nHe himself said: “No one defends Islam like Arab Christians.” It is to defend Islam that Western clerics do not raise their voice against such acts of brutality.\nIt is to pursue a fruitless and chimerical “dialogue” that bishops in the U.S. and Europe keep silent about Muslim persecution of Christians, and enforce that silence upon others.\nRobert McManus, Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, Massachusetts, said it on February 8, 2013 as he was suppressing a planned talk at a Catholic conference on that persecution: “Talk about extreme, militant Islamists and the atrocities that they have perpetrated globally might undercut the positive achievements that we Catholics have attained in our inter-religious dialogue with devout Muslims.”\nRemember that Mohamed Atta, about the plane he had hijacked on September 11, 2001, told passengers over the intercom: “Stay quiet and you’ll be OK.” The Catholic Church appears to have adopted that statement as its policy regarding Muslim persecution of Christians.\n“Leave them;

Kavanaugh — outlined now on the record in the Washington Post by Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford — are substantial and serious.\nShe claims that Kavanaugh knocked her down, groped her, and attempted to remove her clothes.\nHere’s the core of her story:\nWhile his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it.\nWhen she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.\n“I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California.\n“He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.\nShe said she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house.\nDo not count me among those who would minimize this alleged assault.\nI went to a high school that had more than its share of drunken parties, and my classmates could do crazy and stupid things, but an act like this was beyond the pale.\nThis isn’t “boys will be boys.” Actions have consequences, and it’s hardly unjust to tell a person that if he mistreated another human being like this — even a long time ago — he has to remain “merely” a judge on the D.C.\nCircuit Court of Appeals.\nSince Kavanaugh has denied the story, however, the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot.\nAt the very least, if the attack happened, he should be disqualified for lying.\nYet unless all parties start telling the same story, there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred.\nWe don’t need certainty, however, to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the Supreme Court.\nI have the same standard for Brett Kavanaugh as I did for Roy Moore, for Donald Trump, for Bill Clinton — or for any other politician who’s accused of misconduct.\nIs it more likely than not that the allegation is true?\nGiven the totality of the evidence, I believe it is more likely than not that Bill Clinton committed rape and sexual harassment.\nI believe it is more likely than not that Donald Trump has committed sexual assault.\nI believe it is more likely than not that Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls.\nBut the evidence against Kavanaugh falls far short of the evidence arrayed against each of these men.\nSo far at least it falls far short of the evidence against virtually any other politician or celebrity who has faced consequences during this #MeToo moment.\nHere’s why:\nFirst, one way to help test the veracity of old claims is to ask whether there is any contemporaneous corroboration.\nDid the accuser tell a friend or family member or anyone about the alleged assault when it occurred?\nWith Clinton, Trump, Moore, and many other politicians and celebrities, there was ample contemporaneous corroboration.\nHere, there was not.\nAccording to the Washington Post, “Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband.”\nThat’s almost three decades of silence — three decades when memories can grow cloudy and recollections can change.\nBut even the allegedly corroborating notes of the therapist raise a separate problem.\nThey actually contradict her story on a key detail.\nAccording to the Post, “The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy that Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part.\nFord said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.” Nor do the notes mention Kavanaugh’s name, even though her husband says Ford named Kavanaugh in the sessions.\nThose are important discrepancies, and if six years ago she told the therapist four men and says two men now, that suggests that her memory of the event may be suspect.\nAs a former trial lawyer, I can tell you that while neither notes nor memories are infallible, in a contest between contemporaneous notes and later verbal testimony about those notes, the content of the written notes usually prevails.\nJuries are extremely skeptical of witnesses who contradict written notes — after all, the notes are taken when the words are immediate and there isn’t the overwhelming pressure of a trial to conform your testimony to the desired outcome.\nAt least the investigation seems somewhat manageable.\nIf there were only four boys there, who were the other two?\nLet’s hear from them.\nIn fact, investigators should interview everyone else at the party.\nYet given all the years that have passed, would it be possible to find anyone who remembers being at that party?\nWould they remember any details at all?\nIf someone saw Kavanaugh stumbling drunk at the party, that would obviously bolster Ford’s account.\nIf another attendee says, “He was totally sober and with me the whole time,” that helps Kavanaugh.\nBut the odds of getting details that precise are long indeed, and there is always a chance that a motivated classmate might lie — for either person….\n>","completion":"

German Cardinal Reinhard Marx’s suggestion that Catholic priests should consider “blessing” same-sex relationships liturgically.\nMarx’s idea “truly seems sacrilegious” and “ignores the clear Revelation of God,” Cordes wrote in a response on kath.net.\nDr. Maike Hickson translated it at One Peter Five.\n“The Church is in its pastoral care bound to Holy Scripture and to its interpretation through the Church’s Magisterium,” wrote Cordes.\n“Marx does not even mention that homosexuality always contradicts the Will of God,” citing church teaching through the centuries.\nRather than being about receiving “God’s assistance for themselves,” those engaging in sodomy and wishing to have it “blessed” by the Church “aim with their request at the recognition and acceptance of their homosexual way of life and its ecclesial valorization.”\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that “under no circumstances” can homosexual activity “be approved” as it is “intrinsically disordered.” Such acts are “contrary to the natural law.\nThey close the sexual act to the gift of life.\nThey do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity” (CCC 2357).\nHowever, Marx said on February 3 that homosexual couples need “closer pastoral care” and “one must also encourage priests and pastoral workers to give people in concrete situations [of homosexual unions] encouragement.\nI do not really see any problems there.”\nMarx is the President of the German Bishops’ Conference.\nAs LifeSiteNews previously reported, Marx also said “yes,” he could imagine the creation of a rite for homosexual couples to be blessed in the Church.\nThis “encouragement” from priests which he called for might include some sort of “liturgical” recognition of their union.\nBut “how this would be done publicly, in a liturgical form,” is “another question...that is where one has to be reticent and also reflect upon that in a good way.”\nAfter Catholic News Agency’s initial report on Marx’s comments, his office contacted the outlet and said they had mistranslated part of what he said.\nThe cardinal’s office sent CNA “a request for correction of [its] translation of the interview in question, expressing concern that CNA's translation constitutes a false reference and does not properly reflect the position of Cardinal Marx.”\nThe cardinal’s office maintains that rather than saying “yes,” there is a possibility of liturgical “blessing” of gay unions, he answered the question in a more subtle way without giving an explicit “yes.” However, the German Bishops’ Conference doesn’t seem to deny the rest of his statements on how “one must encourage priests” to give encouragement to homosexual couples, which could include public blessings that would take a “liturgical” form.\nThe cardinal’s staff asked that CNA change his answer about liturgically “blessing” gay unions to: “There are no general solutions and I think that would not be right, because we are talking about pastoral care for individual cases, and that applies to other areas as well, which we cannot regulate, where we have no sets of rules.”\nPhiladelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput has also spoken out against Marx’s proposal.\n“Any such ‘blessing rite’ would cooperate in a morally forbidden act, no matter how sincere the persons seeking the blessing,” wrote Chaput.\nHe explained such a “blessing” would encourage people to continue living in a way the Church considers gravely sinful and spiritually damaging, and therefore would be uncharitable.\n“There is no love – no charity – without truth, just as there is no real mercy separated from a framework of justice informed and guided by truth,” he wrote.\n“Creating confusion around important truths of our faith, no matter how positive the intention, only makes a difficult task more difficult.”\n“There are two principles we need to remember,” Chaput wrote.\n“First, we need to treat all people with the respect and pastoral concern they deserve as children of God with inherent dignity.\nThis emphatically includes persons with same-sex attraction.\nSecond, there is no truth, no real mercy, and no authentic compassion, in blessing a course of action that leads persons away from God.”\n“This in no way is a rejection of the persons seeking such a blessing, but rather a refusal to ignore what we know to be true about the nature of marriage, the family, and the dignity of human sexuality,” he explained.\n“Jesus said the truth will make us free.\nNowhere did he suggest it will make us comfortable.”\nCordes has a history of defending the Church’s moral teaching.\nMarx, one of the pope’s nine main advisors, said in 2016 that same-sex relationships have “worth” which must be recognized by the Church.\n>","completion":"

they are billed as pioneering feminists.\nIf there is anything to remember Gillard by, it a warmongering, sycophantic, embarrassing speech she made to the US Congress soon after she demanded the illegal cancellation of Julian’s passport.\nMalcolm Turnbull is now the Prime Minister of Australia.\nJulian Assange’s father has written to Turnbull.\nIt is a moving letter, in which he has appealed to the prime minister to bring his son home.\nHe refers to the real possibility of a tragedy.\nI have watched Assange’s health deteriorate in his years of confinement without sunlight.\nHe has had a relentless cough, but is not even allowed safe passage to and from a hospital for an X-ray.\nMalcolm Turnbull can remain silent.\nOr he can seize this opportunity and use his government’s diplomatic influence to defend the life of an Australian citizen, whose courageous public service is recognised by countless people across the world.\nHe can bring Julian Assange home.\nReprinted with permission from Consortiumnews.com.\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_fear-prejudice|16|85\nLoaded_Language|522|537\nLoaded_Language|982|1059\nName_Calling,Labeling|2100|2117\nLoaded_Language|2422|2440\nLoaded_Language|2690|2722\nLoaded_Language|3435|3495\nName_Calling,Labeling|3790|3820\nName_Calling,Labeling|3827|3886\nLoaded_Language|4225|4243\nName_Calling,Labeling|4246|4270\nName_Calling,Labeling|5347|5383\nLoaded_Language|5932|5950\nLoaded_Language|6924|6977\nName_Calling,Labeling|7005|7052\nLoaded_Language|9479|9499\nLoaded_Language|4441|4461\nLoaded_Language|6478|6496\nLoaded_Language|6559|6573\nName_Calling,Labeling|6930|6943\nExaggeration,Minimisation|8431|8458\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|206|375\nExaggeration,Minimisation|564|630\nName_Calling,Labeling|917|965\nExaggeration,Minimisation|982|1031\nLoaded_Language|1081|1086\nLoaded_Language|1630|1651\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1759|1848\nLoaded_Language|1889|1903\nName_Calling,Labeling|1905|1923\nLoaded_Language|2321|2341\nName_Calling,Labeling|2346|2374\nName_Calling,Labeling|2497|2578\nDoubt|2611|2658\nLoaded_Language|2756|2777\nName_Calling,Labeling|2815|2861\nDoubt|2779|2972\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3279|3305\nName_Calling,Labeling|3522|3544\nLoaded_Language|3725|3748\nFlag-Waving|3750|3771\nDoubt|3889|3968\nLoaded_Language|3951|3968\nLoaded_Language|4028|4046\nExaggeration,Minimisation|4272|4286\nName_Calling,Labeling|4322|4338\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|4354|4394\nLoaded_Language|4396|4416\nLoaded_Language|4486|4529\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|4476|4585\nExaggeration,Minimisation|4809|4869\nLoaded_Language|5144|5164\nExaggeration,Minimisation|5171|5201\nLoaded_Language|5316|5335\nLoaded_Language|5743|5762\nLoaded_Language|6160|6180\nLoaded_Language|6205|6225\nLoaded_Language|6286|6335\nCausal_Oversimplification|6337|6442\nExaggeration,Minimisation|6686|6700\nName_Calling,Labeling|6818|6840\nName_Calling,Labeling|6900|6922\nExaggeration,Minimisation|7352|7484\nLoaded_Language|7498|7590\nLoaded_Language|7634|7678\nExaggeration,Minimisation|7610|7625\nLoaded_Language|7793|7836\nLoaded_Language|7857|7953\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|7853|8050\nLoaded_Language|8233|8248\nLoaded_Language|8277|8307\nFlag-Waving|341|370\nRepetition|9397|9418\nName_Calling,Labeling|9784|9804\nDoubt|9119|9372\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|10444|10686\nFlag-Waving|10562|10602\nExaggeration,Minimisation|10636|10686\nLoaded_Language|564|592\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|2120|2210\nLoaded_Language|4265|4270\nLoaded_Language|9856|9902."}

{"prompt":"Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future\n\nPope Francis visits Genoa, Italy, in May 2017.\n(Reuters photo: Giorgio Perottino)\nIn a debate, Ross Douthat and Massimo Faggioli discussed Pope Francis’s legacy and its effect on internal Church controversies.\nOn Wednesday night, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat and Villanova professor of theology Massimo Faggioli came together for a debate entitled “Francis @ Five: Assessing the Legacy of Pope Francis Five Years after His Election.” As I made my way up to Fordham University, I was excited.\nHaving followed Douthat and Faggioli’s ongoing dialogue on Twitter, I knew I was in for a lively, if predictable, conversation.\nIn his opening remarks, Douthat laid out three criteria that can be used to evaluate Francis’s papacy thus far: his impact on the public’s perception of the Church (a success); his attempts at reforming the Vatican bureaucracy (a disappointment); and his position on “moral-theological controversies,” specifically, communion for the divorced and remarried (a problem).\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nFaggioli, meanwhile, outlined a genuinely surprising position.\nRather than making a straightforward case for why Pope Francis has changed the Church for the better, Faggioli rejected the possibility of evaluating his papacy in terms of “continuity” with past popes, since doing so would assume that “Christianity at some point .\n.\n.\nwas complete,” which Faggioli does not think is true.\nWhile I emphatically disagree with this argument, I have to hand it to Faggioli: From the outset, he made clear that he was not planning to debate Douthat on the implications of the Francis papacy.\nInstead, through a combination of rhetorical tricks and soft-peddled Hegelianism, he would completely redefine the role and nature of the Catholic Church.\nDuring the crux of the debate — the discussion of communion for the divorced and remarried — Faggioli raised his most theologically unsettling point.\nTo defend his position that remarried persons should be able to receive communion, Faggioli invoked the case of Germany, where 50 percent of Catholic marriages end in divorce.\nFor Faggioli, the implication is that at least 50 percent of German Catholic children never see their parents receive communion and lose their faith because of it.\nThis, he says, is “bad for evangelization,” and in order to keep the pews full, the Church’s role should not be to deny communion to the divorced and remarried, but instead to ask, “What can the Catholic Church do to make the faithful able to receive sacraments?”\nAdvertisement\nThis is a lovely suggestion, and one that I’m not entirely unsympathetic to.\nHowever, the fact remains that Faggioli is suggesting the Church do much more than provide sacraments to the faithful.\nJust before invoking the German case, Faggioli characterized the country as one of the most secular in the world.\nBut rather than lamenting what secularism has wrought on marital life in Germany, reasserting the Church’s position on marriage, and insisting that the faithful strive to live according to her laws, Faggioli argues that the Church ought to bend to the will of secular society.\nAdvertisement\nIt should be clear to anyone, not just practicing Catholics, that this is absurd.\nIf the Church exists simply to accommodate the whims and failures of secular modernity, then what is the point of the Church?\nPope Benedict XVI has warned against precisely the kind of “accommodation” Faggioli is calling for, writing that when “the people cannot cope” with God, they “bring him down into their own world,” and insist that “he must be the kind of God that [they need].” In other words, “Man is using God, and, in reality, even if it is not outwardly discernible, he is placing himself above God.” To fully drive the point home, Benedict equates this kind of worship with the Israelites desert worship of the bull calf.\nUnsurprisingly, this progressive interpretation of Catholic doctrine eventually reveals itself to be rank historicism.\nThroughout the debate, Faggioli drew out the argument that allowing the remarried to receive communion would not represent a radical change in doctrine but a return to the teachings of the Gospel.\nEventually, Douthat drew his argument to its logical conclusion with this question: Were priests throughout history in fact misleading their divorced and remarried parishioners by telling them they could not receive communion?\nAfter a few seconds’ pause, Faggioli gave the only answer he could: “There are different responses to the same question in different times.”\nAdvertisement\nThroughout their conversation, both Douthat and Faggioli repeatedly observed that the debate over Pope Francis and the future of the Church is carried on primarily among Catholic intellectuals, unbeknownst to most of “the flock.”\nAdvertisement\nIt strikes me, however, that everybody — Catholic or not — has a dog in this fight, which is about more than communion and canon law.\nAt its core, this debate is about truth and our ability to judge right from wrong.\nCould we possibly say, for instance, that it’s impossible to judge the presidency of Donald Trump relative to past presidents?\nOf course not — that would be preposterous, as I’m sure Faggioli would agree.\nTo pass moral judgements on papacies, presidencies, or anything else, we must have recourse to truth, and to the institutions that have upheld this truth for centuries.\nWhether in the Church or in the academy, we must resist this dangerous historicist impulse.\nIf we don’t, we will find ourselves, in the words of Pope Benedict, in “a dictatorship of relativism that does not recognize anything as definitive and whose ultimate goal consists solely of one’s own ego and desires.”\nAdvertisement\nREAD MORE:\nA Defense of the Catholic Tradition\nThe Left’s New Plan to Gut

{"prompt":"Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused\n\nInternational financial institutions get a lot of heat for terror state ties.\nBut this is a case where Obama Inc. tried to get them to do the wrong thing.\nWhile they did the right thing.\nThe Obama administration secretly sought to give Iran access — albeit briefly — to the U.S. financial system by sidestepping sanctions kept in place after the 2015 nuclear deal, despite repeatedly telling Congress and the public it had no plans to do so.\nYet another Obama dirty deal with Iran that we're just learning about now.\nThe question is how many more are there?\nAnd that's part of why Spygate is happening.\nThe assault is also a cover-up.\nThe report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations revealed that under President Barack Obama, the Treasury Department issued a license in February 2016, never previously disclosed, that would have allowed Iran to convert $5.7 billion it held at a bank in Oman from Omani rials into euros by exchanging them first into U.S. dollars.\nIf the Omani bank had allowed the exchange without such a license, it would have violated sanctions that bar Iran from transactions that touch the U.S. financial system.\nThe effort was unsuccessful because American banks — themselves afraid of running afoul of U.S. sanctions — declined to participate.\nThe Obama administration approached two U.S. banks to facilitate the conversion, the report said, but both refused, citing the reputational risk of doing business with or for Iran.\nThat's how bad Obama was on Iran.\nThe banking system was more reluctant to help Iran launder money than he was.\nNor was Obama worried about the reputational risk of loading foreign currency on unmarked cargo planes and flying it to Iran.\nIssuing the license was not illegal.\nStill, it went above and beyond what the Obama administration was required to do under the terms of the nuclear agreement.\nExcept Obama Inc. weren't trying to drive a hard bargain.\nSo they didn't stick to it.\nThey were trying to aid Iran.\nShortly after the nuclear deal was sealed in July 2015, then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew testified that even with the sanctions relief, Iran “will continue to be denied access to the world’s largest financial and commercial market.” A month later, one of Lew’s top deputies, Adam Szubin, testified that despite the nuclear deal “Iran will be denied access to the world’s most important market and unable to deal in the world’s most important currency.”\nThis was typical of the worthless assurances that Obama officials made.\nAnd disgraced themselves by doing so.\nObama administration officials at the time assured concerned lawmakers that a general license wouldn’t be coming.\nBut the report from the Republican members of the Senate panel showed that a draft of the license was indeed prepared, though it was never published.\nAnd when questioned by lawmakers about the possibility of granting Iran any kind of access to the U.S. financial system, Obama-era officials never volunteered that the specific license for Bank Muscat in Oman had been issued two months earlier.\nScandal-free administration, folks.\nNot a single scandal to see here.\nNot a one.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|522|532\nDoubt|595|618\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2414|2435\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2470|2493\nLoaded_Language|2572|2581\nRepetition|3115|3122\nRepetition|3164|3171\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3185|3194\nName_Calling,Labeling|1540|1543\nLoaded_Language|2520|2529."}
{"prompt":"Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!\n\nInspector General Michael Horowitz’ report on the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email investigation has finally been released to the public and while it does indeed lambaste former FBI Director James Comey for his terrible judgment and handling of the Clinton investigation, it stops short of blaming it all on politics.\nHorowitz’ report not only slams Comey, but it also criticizes former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and immoral FBI philanderers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.\nHorowitz blames Comey, Strzok, and Page for besmirching the good name of the FBI and harming the agencies reputation with the American people.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\n* Dianne Feinstein Maxine Waters Adam Schiff Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand Keith Ellison Cory Booker\nEmail *\nName This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nAt the end of the day, Horowitz was unable to find solid proof that the agency acted in a politically partisan and biased manner in the Clinton email case.\nHowever, the Inspector General left the door open to the possibility that political bias did indeed play a role, as his current investigation in the Russia-Collusion probe of the FBI and the DOJ could reveal new evidence to damn the FBI’s Obama era leadership.\nWhile the report refuses to say conclusively that political bias was the animus behind the FBI’s handling of the Clinton probe, it also indicates that IG Horowitz may have more to say about the FBI’s political leanings in his Russia report.\nThe Washington Post explains:\nThe Justice Department inspector general on Thursday castigated former FBI Director James B. Comey for his actions during the Hillary Clinton email investigation and found that other senior bureau officials showed a “willingness to take official action” to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president… Some senior bureau officials, the report found, exhibited a disturbing “willingness to take official action” to hurt Trump’s chances to become president.\nPerhaps the most damaging new revelation in the report is a previously-unreported text message in which Peter Strzok, a key investigator on both the Clinton email case and the investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign, assured an FBI lawyer in August 2016 that “we’ll stop” Trump from making it to the White House.\n“[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right?\nRight?\n!” the lawyer, Lisa Page, wrote to Strzok.\n“No.\nNo he won’t.\nWe’ll stop it,” Strzok responded…\nThe inspector general concluded that Strzok’s text, along with others disparaging Trump, “is not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate’s electoral prospects.”\nThe messages “potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,” the inspector general wrote…\nStrzok has argued that he was just trying to reassure Page that Trump couldn’t win, and that he wasn’t implying that they would take action to stop his election.\nBut it wasn’t just Page and Strzok, there were FIVE other investigators on the Clinton case who expressed overtly political views in support of Clinton and\/or against Trump… DURING the investigation.\nPage and Strzok are not the only FBI officials assigned to the Clinton email probe who were found to have exchanged personal messages indicating either an animus against Trump or frustration with the fact that the FBI was investigating Clinton.\nThe report identified five officials with some connection to the email probe who were expressing political views, faulting them for having brought “discredit to themselves, sowed doubt about the FBI’s handling of the midyear investigation, and impacted the reputation of the FBI.” The midyear investigation refers to the Clinton email probe.\n“The messages cast a cloud over the FBI investigations to which these employees were assigned,” Horowitz alleged.\n“Ultimately the consequences of these actions impact not only the senders of these messages but also other who worked on these investigation and, indeed, the entire FBI.”\nThe IG also found that the FBI moved slowly on new evidence that could have damned Hillary Clinton, and did so for reasons that make no sense.\nThe report took particular aim at FBI officials investigating Clinton’s email server for moving slowly after agents in the New York Field office discovered messages on the laptop of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner that might be relevant to their case.\nBy no later than September 29, the inspector general alleged, the bureau had learned “virtually every fact” it would cite as justification late the next month to search Weiner’s laptop for messages of Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin.\nThe inspector general derided the bureau’s reasons for not moving more quickly — that agents were waiting for additional information from New York, that they couldn’t move without a warrant and that investigators were more focused on the Russia case — as “unpersuasive,” “illogical,” and inconsistent with their assertion that they would leave no stone unturned on Clinton.\nThe report also faulted the bureau for assigning essentially the same personnel to the Russia and Clinton teams, and singled out Strzok, suggesting his anti-Trump views might have played a role in his not acting more expeditiously on the new lead.\n“Under these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias,” the report said.\nDid you get that?\nIG Horowitz can’t prove it, but he’s not sure that Strzok wasn’t acting in a politically biased manner when he slow-played the Clinton investigation while moving more quickly on the Russia investigation.\nHow in the world can we trust them even as they express bias while investigating malfeasance?\nWe see this kind of corruption all over the world, why should believe that these officials could be immune to acting on their personal biases?\nThere were 7 of them on the case, and they were comfortable enough with each other to express their biases openly and none of them ever chastised the others for expressing those biases!\nNot only that, the team that handled Clinton’s investigation so poorly was almost the identical team that was then assigned to handle the Russia investigation!\nMeaning, the obviously politically biased team that had just cleared the woman that they supported, was now tapped to investigate if the man that they hated was tied to Russian corruption.\nThis is INSANE.\nMeanwhile, another story just breaking at Fox News provides even more evidence that Peter Strzok is the big bad guy in the FBI mess.\nNot only was he slow-playing the Clinton investigation, he may be the only reason she was never charged with a crime.\nIn a newly released FBI email, we learned that “foreign actors” gained at least some access to Hillary Clinton’s unsecure email system.\nFox News obtained the memo prepared by the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, which lays out key interim findings ahead of next week’s hearing with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz.\nThe IG, separately, is expected to release his highly anticipated report on the Clinton email case later Thursday.\nThe House committees, which conducted a joint probe into decisions made by the DOJ in 2016 and 2017, addressed a range of issues in their memo including Clinton’s email security.\n“Documents provided to the Committees show foreign actors obtained access to some of Mrs. Clinton’s emails — including at least one email classified ‘Secret,'” the memo says, adding that foreign actors also accessed the private accounts of some Clinton staffers.\nHere’s the email in question:\nPeter Strzok email about Clinton emails by Fox News on Scribd\nThe email came from FBI agent Peter Strzok and it’s the first place we see the question of whether or not Clinton can be found as “grossly negligent,” in the handling of classified intel.\nRemember, Strzok is widely credited as the man who changed FBI Director Comey’s language on the Clinton email investigation from the prosecutable “grossly negligent” to the legally superflous “extremely careless.”\nAt HotAir.com John Sexton explains the importance of this discovery:\nIn the FBI memo, you can already see the genesis of the distinction the FBI would rely on to clear Clinton.\nStrzok writes that the media has been focused on the question of why Hillary seems to be getting a pass when “Petraeus\/Berger\/Libby” did not.\nHe writes, “We draw the distinction in noting we have no evidence classified information was ever shared with an unauthorized party, i.e.\nnotwithstanding the server setup, we have not seen classified information shared with a member of the media, an agent of a foreign power, a lover, etc.” In other words, Hillary may have been hacked but she didn’t intentionally give anything away.\nOf course, the statute itself didn’t make intent a prerequisite.\nHerridge reports that the House committee memo once again raises this same issue: “Officials from both agencies have created a perception they misinterpreted the Espionage Act by stating Secretary Clinton lacked the requisite ‘intent’ for charges to be filed,” the memo says, before pointing to statements by Comey that indicated a belief that intent was required — which the memo says ignored “meaningful aspects” of the law.\nIt really does seem that Strzok, an agent who had a personal pro-Hillary bias, was the person who pushed to let her off the hook by focusing on her intent rather than her negligence setting up the server in the first place.\nI fully believe IG Horowitz’ findings here.\nI believe that he was unable to prove that there was any political motive to the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email case, and I believe that while the case was obviously mishandled, it could have reached the conclusion it did honorably.\nHowever, I also think that the IG has purposely left room in his conclusion to amend that decision after he’s concluded his Russia investigation.\nIn fact, there are already signs of him doing that in this report.\nMuch of the information that he uses to chastise Strzok’s behavior and judgment in the Clinton email case, would have actually come from his current investigation into the Russia mess.\nIt’s quite possible that as bad as this report is for Comey, Strzok, Page, and Obama’s FBI leadership… Horowitz’ conclusion in the Russia investigation could prove to be even worse.\nWe’ll see.\nArticle posted with permission from

{"prompt":"PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study\n\nScientists say our Sun will likely enter a cooldown cycle as soon as 2050, but the phase has almost no effect on global warming.\nPhysicist Dan Lubin at the University of California San Diego and two of his colleges managed to collect and observe relevant data for the past 20 years and came to the conclusion that the giant burning ball of gas in our planetary system might enter a “grand minimum” period of decreased ultraviolet radiation that would last for some 11 years by mid-century.\n“The cooldown… [is] a periodic event during which the Sun’s magnetism diminishes, sunspots form infrequently, and less ultraviolet radiation (UV) makes it to the surface of the planet,” researchers noted in a statement earlier this week, adding that “the event is triggered at irregular intervals by random fluctuations related to the Sun’s magnetic field.”\nThe study, whose results were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said the Sun is likely to be 6.9 percent cooler than its usual lowest amount of activity in the grand minimum.\nAccording to the researchers, the cooldown phase could echo those experienced in Europe in the mid-17th century, called the “Maunder Minimum,” or the prolonged sunspot minimum, during which temperatures were low enough to cause London's River Thames to freeze over on a regular basis and to freeze the Baltic Sea to such an extent that Swedish troops were able to invade Denmark in 1658 on foot by marching across the sea ice.\nHowever, scientists warned that it should not be assumed that the ultra-cooling of the sun would potentially prevent the negative effects of global warming.\n“The cooling effect of a grand minimum is only a fraction of the warming effect caused by the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,” they said, adding, “After hundreds of thousands of years of CO2 levels never exceeding 300 parts per million in air, the concentration of the greenhouse gas is now over 400 parts per million, continuing a rise that began with the Industrial Revolution.”\nThe study estimated that the Sun’s mid-century cooldown would probably only result in cooling the Earth by some 0.25 percent between 2020 and 2070.\nAs a result, the temperature at the surface of our cosmic home would decrease by up to several tenths of a degree Celsius, which is not sufficient to stop global warming, but it could at least soften its effects in part.\n“Now we have a benchmark from which we can perform better climate model simulations.\nWe can therefore have a better idea of how changes in solar UV radiation affect climate change,” said Lubin.\n>","completion":" no propaganda found."}

Boehner should probably re-check the old party's pulse, for the Bush-Boehner GOP may not just be napping.\nIt could be comatose.\nConsider.\nThat GOP was dedicated to free trade, open borders, amnesty and using U.S. power to punish aggressors and \"end tyranny in our world.\"\nThat GOP set out to create a new world order where dictatorships were threatened with \"regime change,\" and democratic capitalism was the new order of the ages.\nYet, Donald Trump captured the Republican nomination and won the presidency—by saying goodbye to all that.\nHow probable is it that a future GOP presidential candidate will revive the Bush-Boehner agenda the party rejected in 2016, run on it, win, and impose it on the party and nation?\nBush-Boehner Republicanism appears to be as dead today as was Harding-Coolidge Republicanism after 1933.\nAnd if Trumpism is not the future of the GOP, it is hard to see what a promising GOP agenda might look like.\nA brief history: In seven elections starting in 1992, Republicans won the presidency three times, but the popular vote only once, in 2004, when George W. was still basking in his \"Mission Accomplished\" in Iraq.\nWhat fractured and overwhelmed the Bush-Boehner Republican Party?\nFirst, demography.\nThe mass immigration of Third World peoples that began with the 1965 immigration act, and the decline in the birth rate of native-born Americans, began to swamp the Nixon-Reagan New Majority.\nSecond, the collapse of the Soviet Empire and USSR removed the party's great unifying cause from Eisenhower to Bush I—the Cold War.\nAfter the Red Army went home, \"America First\" had a new appeal!\nThird, faithful to the free trade cult in which they were raised, Republicans championed NAFTA, the WTO, and MFN for China.\nHistorians will look back in amazement at how America's free trade zealots gave away the greatest manufacturing base the world had ever seen, as they quoted approvingly 18th- and 19th-century scribblers whose ideas had done so much to bring down their own country, Great Britain.\nBetween 1997 and 2017, the EU ran up, at America's expense, trade surpluses in goods in excess of $2 trillion, while we also picked up the bill for Europe's defense.\nBetween 1992 and 2016, China was allowed to run $4 trillion in trade surpluses at our expense, converting herself into the world's first manufacturing power and denuding America of tens of thousands of factories and millions of manufacturing jobs.\nIn Trump's first year, China's trade surplus with the United States hit $375 billion.\nFrom January to March of this year, our trade deficit with China was running at close to the same astronomical rate.\n\"Trade deficits do not matter,\" we hear from the economists.\nThey might explain that to Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\nAnd perhaps someone can explain the wisdom of handing 4 percent of our GDP each year to an adversary nation, as U.S. admirals talk tough about confronting that adversary nation over islets and reefs in the South China Sea.\nWhy are we enriching and empowering so exorbitantly those whom we are told we may have to fight?\nFourth, under Bush II and Obama, the U.S. intervened massively in the Near and Middle East—in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen.\nAnd the forces that pushed up into those conflicts, and so disillusioned the nation that it elected Barack Obama, are back, pushing for a new war, on Iran.\nThey may get this war, too.\nYet, given the anti-interventionist and anti-war stance of Trump's winning campaign, and of the Bernie Sanders campaign, U.S. involvement in Middle East wars seems less America's future than it does her past.\nAfter his 16 months in office, it appears as though the Trump presidency, no matter how brief, is going to be a watershed moment in U.S. and world history, and in the future of the GOP.\nThe world is changing.\nNATO and the EU are showing their age.\nNationalism, populism and tribalism are pervasive on the Old Continent.\nAnd America's willingness to bear the burden of Europe's defense, as they ride virtually free, is visibly waning.\nIt is hard to see why or how Republicans are ever again going to be the Bush-Boehner party that preceded the rise of Trump.\nWhat would be the argument for returning to a repudiated platform?\nTrump not only defeated 16 Bush Republicans, he presented an agenda on immigration, border security, amnesty, intervention abroad, the Middle East, NAFTA, free trade, Putin and Russia that was a rejection of what the Bush-Boehner Party had stood for and what its presidential candidates in 2008 and 2012, John McCain and Mitt Romney, had run on.\nIf the Republican Party is \"napping,\" let it slumber on, undisturbed, for its time has come and gone.\nWe are in a

{"prompt":"Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid\n\nBy Nick Brown\nFeb 9 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico said on Friday it will receive $16 billion in federal aid under a disaster recovery package signed on Friday by U.S. President Donald Trump.\nThat money includes nearly $7 billion announced on Wednesday and will help the bankrupt U.S. territory recover from September's Hurricane Maria, according to a statement on Friday from Governor Ricardo Rossello and Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's nonvoting member of the U.S. Congress.\nRossello said on Wednesday that Puerto Rico would get $4.9 billion to shore up its near-insolvent Medicaid system and another $2 billion or so under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to repair its destroyed electric grid.\nOn Friday, Rossello and Gonzalez said the island would receive a total of $11 billion under CDBG, a program run by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nThe additional portion would be used to help local businesses and repair and build new homes, they said.\nIn addition to a slow recovery from Hurricane Maria, its worst natural disaster in 90 years, Puerto Rico is navigating the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, with a combined $120 billion in bond and pension debt.\nThe aid announced on Friday provides just a fraction of the $94.4 billion Rossello has said the island needs to recover from cataclysmic damage to its infrastructure and housing stock, although Puerto Rico is eligible to participate in other programs that could increase the aid to $45 billion, according to Friday's statement.\nCongress could also appropriate more money later.\nThe governor has asked Congress for $46 billion in CDBG funding alone.\nHome damage in Puerto Rico, where the poverty rate is around 46 percent, was exacerbated by the existence of hundreds of thousands of sub-standard \"informal\" homes, which are typically built by the owners themselves, without permits and often in squatter communities.\n\"The work carried out in Washington - together with resident commissioner Jenniffer González - was able to deliver the message of the urgency of an allocation of funds that meets the needs of the Island,\" the governor said in Friday's statement.\nThe disaster aid package signed by Trump on Friday - around $90 billion in total - covers a number of major disasters, including Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria, as well as the recent California wildfires.\n(Reporting by Nick Brown; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|1399|1417\nName_Calling,Labeling|1857|1886."}
{"prompt":"9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad\n\n[Pre-Order Jamie Glazov's new book, Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us, HERE.]\nEditors’ note: In light of the skyrocketing phenomenon of Muslim migrants stabbing unbelievers in random stabbing sprees in Europe, as well as the calculated denial that leaders, authorities and media are enforcing about it, Frontpage has deemed it important to bring attention to the crucial steps America and the West must take to robustly confront the unceasing onslaught by Jihad and its leftist enablers.\nWe are, therefore, reprinting below Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov’s July 12, 2016 Breitbart article, \"9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad\".\nHaving written the article in the closing chapter of the disastrous Obama administration, the author recognizes and celebrates the life-saving turn-around disposition that the Trump administration has brought in to counter Jihad.\nFrontpage is most confident that the suggested steps below will continue to be the overall focus of the new administration -- which, thankfully, is now taking many of the crucial and constructive steps vis-à-vis our enemy.\nWe find the article more relevant and urgent than ever due to the 17th anniversary of 9\/11 approaching tomorrow:\n*\n9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.\nBy Jamie Glazov\nWhile the Obama administration continues to allow the Muslim Brotherhood to direct American foreign policy and, therefore, to implement “strategies” that render America defenseless in the face of Jihad and stealth Jihad, there are some alternative strategies that have the potential to turn this catastrophic situation around completely in America’s favor.\nBelow are 9 concrete steps that, if implemented by a future American administration, would make a big difference in preserving our civilization and in defending Americans from terrorism:\n1.\nLabel the Enemy and Make a Threat Assessment.\nThe Obama administration continues to refuse to label our enemy and, therefore, it continues to enable our defeat in the terror war.\nIt is urgent that we name our enemy (i.e.\nIslamic Jihad) and definitively identify what ideology inspires our enemy (i.e.\nIslamic law).\n2.\nScrap “Countering Violent Extremism.”\n“Countering Violent Extremism” is the pathetic and destructive focus of the Obama administration in allegedly fighting the terror war.\nOn the one hand, this “focus” is vague to the point of being meaningless and completely incapacitates us.\nOn the other hand, this focus allows the administration to perpetuate the destructive fantasy that there are other types of “extremists” — who just happen to be the Left’s political opponents — that pose a great threat to the country.\nFor example, as Stephen Coughlin has revealed, the “violent extremists” the administration is clearly worried about are the “right-wing Islamophobes” whom the administration obviously considers to be the real threat to American security.\nThe “Countering Violent Extremism” is trash and needs to be thrown in the garbage.\n3.\nStop “Partnering” With Muslim Brotherhood Front Groups.\nThe government needs to stop cooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA immediately.\nThe Muslim Brotherhood document, the Explanatory Memorandum, has made it clear that the Brotherhood’s objective is to destroy our civilization from within by our own hands with the influence of these groups.\nMoreover, as Robert Spencer advises, there needs to be legislation that will bar all such groups and affiliated individuals from advising the government or receiving any grants from it.\n4.\nImplement a Concrete “Countering-Jihad” Strategy.\nAfter discarding the “Countering Violent Extremism” absurdity, a concrete Counter-Jihad strategy must become an official policy.\nIt must specifically register that Jihadists are the enemies and that Islamic law (Sharia) is what specifically motivates them.\nMost importantly, as Sebastian Gorka urges in Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, the government needs to lay down a vision, an actual “threat doctrine analysis” in a thorough document, just like George Kennan’s Long Telegram and NSC-68 did in laying out the strategic foundation to fighting communism in the Cold War.\nIt is absolutely mind-boggling that nothing of this sort exists today in our terror war — and it is a reflection of the Left being in charge and of the destructive defeat that it is sowing.\n5.\nLaunch Our Own Counter-propaganda Campaign.\nThe Left and Islamists engage in propaganda 24\/7.\nWhat does our propaganda war entail?\nZilch.\nSebastian Gorka is crucially correct, therefore, when he recommends a national counter-propaganda campaign that involves a two-part approach: the first being the bolstering of efforts to define our enemy (Steps #1 and #4 above) and, second, the strengthening of our allies and partners in their own counter-propaganda efforts – which must include our empowering of Muslims who are trying to form an anti-Jihadist version of Islam.\nConsequently, educational programs have to be set up everywhere, from public schools to universities to workplaces, in businesses and numerous other institutions.\nThese programs must crystallize what exactly Islamic Law is and how it inspires and sanctions violence against unbelievers.\nThis has to also involve, as Gorka urges, “a nationwide program of education that includes the armed services as well as federal, state, and local police forces and the intelligence community.”\nThe education campaign must also focus on the second part of Gorka’s counter-propaganda campaign, which is to help strengthen Muslims who seek to seize Islam from the jihadists’ hands.\n6.\nAffirm Sharia’s Assault on the U.S. Constitution as Seditious.\nOnce the truth is accepted that jihadis are inspired and sanctioned by their Islamic texts, it must logically become required that mosques, Islamic schools and groups have to immediately curtail any teaching that motivates sedition, violence, and hatred of unbelievers (i.e.\nremember how CAIR advised Muslims not to talk to the FBI).\nIndeed, once the government discerns and labels the elements of Islamic law that threaten the American Constitution, any preaching and spreading of those elements in America must be labelled as seditious.\n7.\nPut Pressure on Mosques, Islamic Groups and Schools.\nAuthorities have to start subjecting mosques and other Islamic institutions to surveillance — and discard the suicidal leftist notion that it is “racist” and Islamophobic to do so.\nIslamic institutions have to be made to buffer their lip-service against terror with actually doing something about it.\nAs Robert Spencer counsels, this has to involve introducing programs that teach against jihadists’ understanding of Islam — and these programs have to be regularly monitored by the government.\n(This will be a part of Gorka’s suggested counter-propaganda campaign discussed in Step #5).\nSpencer rightly stresses that the paradigm has to become that Muslim communities have to win the “trust” of intelligence and law enforcement agents, rather than the other way around, which is, absurdly and tragically, the case right now.\n8.\nBring Counter-Jihadists into the Government.\nInstead of having Muslim Brotherhood sympathizers like Mohamed Elibiary serving on the U.S.\nHomeland Security Advisory Council (he “resigned” in Sept. 2014 under mysterious circumstances), and Muslim Brotherhood-linked individuals like Huma Abedin serving as the right-hand woman of Hillary Clinton, we need to bring in people who actually love America and want to protect it.\nWe all know who these noble and courageous individuals are – and some of them are referenced in this article.\nThe government must also bring in brave Muslim individuals who genuinely reject Jihad and empower them in propagating their anti-jihadist vision for Islam.\n(P.S.\nYes, there is an argument to be made that Islam cannot be Islam without Jihad.\nBut the debate over this belongs in another forum.\nAnd whatever the answer, it does not mean that the effort to empower Muslims who want to make the anti-jihadist Islamic vision possible should not be made.)\n9.\nRidicule the Enemy.\nRidicule is a vicious and potent weapon.\nThere is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture’s sphere of comedy, especially in Hollywood and our media, with regard to the myriad ingredients of Sharia and Jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches.\nBill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives’ eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit.\nAmerican comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher’s footsteps and Americans need to encourage and equip them to do so – and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces.\nWe must never underestimate the crippling effect of comedy on the totalitarian Mullahs of the world.\nIndeed, the contemptuous, snickering and roaring laughter of people, as they gaze at the pathetic rules and lives of Sharia’s gatekeepers, poses a danger to tyrants like no other.\nJamie Glazov holds a Ph.D. in History with a specialty in Russian, U.S. and Canadian foreign policy.\nHe is the editor of Frontpagemag.com, the author of the critically-acclaimed,

Canova of the Northern District of Florida, Maria Chapa Lopez of the Middle District of Florida and Ariana Fajardo Orshan in the Southern District of Florida.\nThe records released by DOS, which is part of Gov.\nRick Scott’s administration, point the finger at the Florida Democratic Party.\nPolitical parties can get daily lists of people who had their mail-in ballots rejected.\nPolitical parties — or anyone else — can also get the publicly available cure affidavits and send them to voters who had a mail-in ballot rejected to encourage them to fix the ballots.\nIn an email chain released as part of the Department of State’s Tuesday document dump, Citrus County Supervisor of Elections Susan Gill last week told DOS officials that a voter who received one of the cure affidavits with the wrong date had also received a call from a number identified as the Tallahassee office of the Florida Democratic Party, an indication the party was reaching out about her vote by mail ballot.\n“When I called it, it is the Democratic Party of Florida,” she said in a Nov. 8 email to DOS officials.\nShe went on to write that she thinks the incorrect date was used because whoever sent the cure affidavit mixed up the deadline for cure affidavits with the deadline for provisional ballots.\nBut, she said, “a bigger problem is the fact they actually changed one of the DOE forms.”…\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|86|101\nExaggeration,Minimisation|160|178\nFlag-Waving|384|464\nExaggeration,Minimisation|466|560\nDoubt|2509|2712\nName_Calling,Labeling|2537|2584\nLoaded_Language|2596|2616\nLoaded_Language|3635|3651\nAppeal_to_Authority|2946|3341\nLoaded_Language|165|172\nName_Calling,Labeling|292|320\nLoaded_Language|475|481\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|4687|4758."}

{"prompt":"Wait!\nWait!\nIt’s all a MISTRANSLATION!\n\nThus, it took more than a year-and-a-half for the Factory to roll out the old reliable “mistranslation” defense to explain away the infamous paragraph 303 of Amoris Laetita (AL), which reads as follows in the official English translation on the Vatican website:\nYet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel.\nIt can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one’s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal.\nIn other words, the conscience can “inform” a sinner that his continued sinning is not only acceptable to God but is even what God is asking “for now,” given one’s particular “limits.” This outrageous proposition, a form of situation ethics that strikes at the very foundation of Catholic moral teaching, has justly provoked a storm of criticism from lay and clerical defenders of the authentic Magisterium.\n\nBut it’s all a misunderstanding, say Dr. Robert Fastiggi, professor of Systematic Theology at Sacred Heart Major Seminary, and Dr.\nDawn Eden Goldstein, S.T.D., professor of Dogmatic Theology at Holy Apostles College and Seminary.\nAll of the critics of AL are wrong—every one of them!—because, you see, the original Latin text does not say what the English text does.\nDr. Robert Fastiggi and Dr.\nDawn Goldstein\nHere we go again.\nSo what does the Latin say?\nHere is the paragraph in the official Latin:\nHaec autem conscientia agnoscere potest non modo statum quendam ab universali Evangelii mandato obiective dissidere; etiam sincere honesteque agnoscere poteste quod sit liberale responsum in praesenti Deo reddendum atque eadem conscientia firma quadam morali certitudine intellegere illam esse oblationem quam ipse Deus requirit inter rerum impedientium congeriem, quamvis perfectum nondum sit obiectivum exemplar.\nYes, and so what?\nWell, according to Fastiggi and Goldstein, while the English translation reads: “what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God,” the Latin employs the word oblationem, which means offering.\nSo, What the Pope Really Means® is: “what for now is the most generous offering which can be given to God.” So, it’s an offering to God, not a response to God.\nBig difference.\n\nBut just a moment: how can objectively immoral behavior ever be characterized as an “offering” to God?\nIt would seem the Latin version has graver implications than the English because it suggests that falling short of what the moral law requires is an oblation pleasing to God if one’s “limits” make obedience to the moral law difficult.\nAnd that is exactly the nonsense Fastiggi and Goldstein expect us to swallow: “Pope Francis is not talking about an offering of an objectively sinful action but a gift of self that moves toward God and the objective moral norm.”\n\nSo, our intrepid presenters of What the Pope Really Means® would have us believe that objectively immoral behavior, which is the best one can do according “the “concrete complexity of one’s limits,” is no longer simply objectively immoral behavior but rather a gift of self because it moves toward morally licit behavior.\nFastiggi and Goldstein have managed to make the problem even worse in their attempt to explain it away.\n\nWhat about the English locution “while yet not fully the objective ideal,” which seems to reduce the negative precepts of the natural law to mere ideals?\nNot so, Fastiggi and Goldstein contend.\nDo not all those ignorant critics of AL know that the Latin text employs the phrase “obiectivum exemplar,” which, translated literally into English is “objective exemplar.” They declare triumphantly: “The Latin term exemplar does not mean an unattainable ideal, it specifically means a pattern or model to follow.”\n\nGive.\nMe.\nA.\nBreak.\nA pattern or model to follow is an ideal, as a standard Latin dictionary confirms with its definition of exemplar: “(1) copy\/reproduction, (2) model, pattern, example, original, ideal.\nLikewise, the definition of the English word “exemplar” is simply: “an ideal model.”\n\nHere too Fastiggi and Goldsetein only worsen the problem they try to explain away.\nFor if moral behavior is now to be viewed as merely “exemplary” rather than divinely mandated by the natural law that binds all men—including Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery—then basic morality becomes a kind of heroic virtue.\nThus, continence cannot realistically be expected, at least “for now” (AL 303), of the average Joe or Jane with an “ex” who has “remarried” and is now mired in the “concrete complexity one’s limits.”\n\nSo, as Fastiggi and Goldstein would have it, all the tumult triggered by AL is just a misunderstanding caused by uninformed people who haven’t consulted the Latin text—including those ignorant Vatican translators.\nAccording to their proposed “alternate translation” into English, What the Pope Really Means® is that objectively immoral behavior one feels unable to correct due to one’s “limits” is “the offering that God himself is asking amid the mass of impediments, although it may not yet be the perfect objective model.” Which is what the official English translation already says but with fewer words.\n\nIt seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice that their linguistic tinkering produces no real change in meaning but only an intensification of its perniciousness.\nIndeed, their “proposed alternate translation” reduces the avoidance of adulterous relations in “second marriages” to the “perfect objective model.” Now, how could anyone but a Pharisee expect perfection from people living in adultery?\nAre you perfect?\nThen again, the Pharisees are precisely the ones Our Lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law.\nBut such embarrassing truths need not impede the Bergoglian Mercy Train as it barrels toward a train wreck at the end of the line.\nAnd Fastiggi and Goldstein are busily helping it along, changing red signals to green.\nNo problem here!\nhas been the mantra of the neo-Catholic establishment for nearly half a century of ecclesial auto-demolition.\n\nBut wait, there’s more!\nOur dynamic translators even provide their own dynamic interpretation of AL to mean that the “offering” to God of which Francis speaks is merely the decision by a divorced and “remarried” couple with children not to end their relationship, which would be the “perfect objective model,” but rather to “live in continence until they may—after the hoped for declaration of nullity—enter into a true marriage.” That is, they would have Francis affirming John Paul II’s Familiaris consortio, which repeats the Church’s constant teaching that continence is required of those who have entered into adulterous “second marriage,” failing which they cannot be admitted to the sacraments.\n\nBut the Fastiggi-Goldstein interpretation is precisely the contrary of the interpretation Francis has assiduously promoted and which Fastiggi and Goldstein just as assiduously ignore: i.e., that people in “second marriages” do not have to live in continence, but rather—in “certain cases”—may continue their adulterous relations while receiving absolution and Holy Communion during a “process of discernment.” As we know, in his letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires, published on the Vatican website (in response to a query he himself may have solicited), Bergoglio informed them “there is no other interpretation.”\n\nMoreover, the Maltese bishops' “guidelines” for implementing AL, published in L’Osservatore Romano—for which Bergoglio thanked them—declare thus:\nIf, as a result of the process of discernment, undertaken with “humility, discretion and love for the Church and her teaching, in a sincere search for God’s will and a desire to make a more perfect response to it” (AL 300), a separated or divorced person who is living in a new relationship manages, with an informed and enlightened conscience, to acknowledge and believe that he or she are at peace with God, he or she cannot be precluded from participating in the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (see AL, notes 336 and 351).\nThis Pope’s plan of promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document whose heterodox interpretation and application he would later approve with a series of sub-magisterial winks and nods, both oral and written, is the reason I signed onto the Correctio Filialis.\nSee the piece by Joseph Shaw in this regard.\n\nShaw maintains that AL can be “bent into some kind of orthodoxy.” Perhaps.\nBut it is not our responsibility to bend a Pope’s statements into conformity with the Faith.\nMoreover, any Pope who promulgates a document that can be read as orthodox only by a forced interpretation imposed by certain readers—while others disagree—has by that very fact inflicted grave harm upon on the Church, which he alone has the duty to correct.\nBut Francis, as any reasonable observer can see, has no intention of offering any such correction.\nQuite to the contrary, confusion as a cover for the introduction of Holy Communion for “certain” public adulterers by Bergoglio’s co-conspirators in the Vatican and various dioceses is exactly what he was aiming to achieve from the beginning of the whole synodal charade, which was merely a vehicle for promulgation of AL.\nAs Shaw observes of AL: “What we [the signers of the Correctio] are saying is that it has become clear that orthodoxy is not what Pope Francis wants us to find there.”\n\nIn a sense, what Bergoglio is doing is worse than explicit heresy, which could at least be readily identified and denounced as such.\nBut Bergoglio wants the effects of heresy—undermining Holy Matrimony, Confession and Holy Communion, whose integrity is affirmed verbally—without the guilt of an explicit promulgation.\nIn so acting, he is very much in the mold of Honorius I, who was posthumously anathematized by an ecumenical council (the Third Council of Constantinople) and by his own successor (Leo II) for aiding and abetting the spread of the Monothelite heresy (no human but only a divine will in Christ).\nHonorius did so by means of private correspondence with the author of the heresy, endorsing the heresy without ever formally proclaiming it as doctrine.\nAnd yet Honorius I is listed in the canon of the Popes and is not considered to have fallen from office on account of heresy.\nA similar judgment might well befall this Pope, but it is not for us to level it.\n\nMeanwhile, as Fastiggi and Goldstein labor to convince us that nothing is amiss with AL, Pope Bergoglio is sending clear signals of concern about the rising opposition among the faithful to his master plan to subvert the Church according to his false notion of mercy.\nIn a classic power move, he has just given a sop to Cardinal Burke, the perceived leader of the opposition, by appointing him to a minor position on the Apostolic Signatura—the same tribunal from which Bergoglio brutally removed him as Prefect.\nAnd this after also humiliating Burke as the spiritual patron of the Knights of Malta, to which he was exiled after his removal.\n\nWill this sop buy Burke’s silence, staving off the feared public correction?\nWe will soon know if the Cardinal can be bought so easily.\nBut this move demonstrates—if more evidence were needed—that Bergoglio has never been the humble apostle of mercy depicted in his carefully crafted public relations narrative, but rather a cunning ecclesiastical politician, constantly plotting and scheming to get what he wants.\nThat the neo-Catholic establishment refuses to recognize the grim reality of this unprecedented pontificate is but another page in the long annals of its shameful defense of the indefensible to the detriment of Holy Mother Church.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition\n\nOf that book, no less than Robert Royal—signaling growing alarm over the Bergoglian Debacle in the Catholic mainstream— has written : “About 90 percent of it is simply incontrovertible, and cannot help but clarify who Francis is and what he’s about.” And the picture that emerges in stark relief in The Dictator Pope, as Life Site News reports , is that of “a power-hungry, manipulative dictator, [who] celebrated the abdication of Benedict XVI” because he knew what it meant: that the plan to give him the Keys of Peter in 2005 would finally come to fruition in 2013.\n“We elected you to make reforms, not to smash everything!” Thus is Cardinal Leonardi Sandri, a fellow Argentinian and a supporter of Pope Francis at the conclave of 2013, reliably reported literally to have screamed at Pope Francis behind closed doors in the Vatican.\nSandri would be one of a number of Bergoglian partisans at the conclave who are now said to be experiencing “buyer’s remorse,” as documented most recently in the explosive best-seller The Dictator Pope .\n\"When the shepherd becomes a wolf, the first duty of the flock is to defend itself.\nThe true children of Holy Church, at such times, are those who walk by the light of their Baptism, not the cowardly souls who, under the specious pretext of submission to the powers that be, delay their opposition to the enemy in the hope of receiving instructions which are neither necessary nor desirable.\"\nFrancis, writes Royal, “has little use for established procedures, precedents, even legal structures within the Church….\nWhen the head of the Church himself does not much feel bound by the tradition or impartial laws he has inherited, what then?” What then indeed?\nThe Dictator Pope even feels at liberty to demand that the Lord’s Prayer be changed to reflect his dissatisfaction with God’s words: “And lead us not into temptation [et ne nos inducas in tentationem],” which Francis has decided, after 2,000 years, is a “not a good translation.” Apparently lost on Francis, given the disordered mélange of bits and pieces of things he has read that constitutes his theology, is the distinction between sin, a culpable act, and temptation, which arises from concupiscence or what Saint Thomas called the fomes, or the fleshly inclination to sin, which grace enables us to control by the rule of reason over the passions.\nBut now we are witness to the single worst act of tyranny in the entire history of the papacy.\nThe Church has seen a number of Popes who have abused their power, Alexander VI being the most popularly known example.\nBut never, before Francis, has there been a Pope who dared to tyrannize the Magisterium itself by attempting to bend it to his errant personal opinions.\nBy publication in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Francis has officially declared that the “authentic Magisterium” includes the guidelines of the bishops of Buenos Aires for the implementation of Chapter 8 of Amoris Laetitia (AL), which he expressly approved in his letter to them as the only correct interpretation of his will.\nThe guidelines have been published in the AAS along with Francis’s private missive, which is suddenly declared to be “an apostolic letter.”\nThe normalist narrative has just been stripped of any colorable argument that nothing is too terribly amiss with this pontificate.\nWe are now expected to believe that the “authentic Magisterium”—meaning simply and only AL—teaches what the guidelines preposterously declare, solely in reliance on AL:\nWhen the concrete circumstances of a couple make it feasible, especially when both are Christians with a journey of faith, one may propose that they commit to living in continence….\n\nIn other more complex circumstances, and when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity, the aforementioned option may not, in fact, be viable.\nNonetheless, it is equally possible to undertake a journey of discernment….\n[I]f one arrives at the recognition that, in a concrete case, there are limitations that diminish responsibility and culpability (cf.\n301-302), particularly when a person judges that he would fall into a subsequent fault by damaging the children of the new union, Amoris Laetitia opens up the possibility of access to the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (cf.\nnotes 336 and 351).\nAs Francis would have it, then, the “authentic Magisterium” has just flatly contradicted itself for the first time in two millennia:\nThe admission of public adulterers in “second marriages” to Holy Communion, which John Paul II, in line with all of Tradition, called “ intrinsically impossible ” given their objective state in life, is now deemed possible depending on circumstances—that is, situation ethics applied to violations of the Sixth Commandment.\n\nThe requirement that people embroiled in such unions commit to living in continence before they can be absolved and partake of the Blessed Sacrament—a moral norm binding “ without exception ” because it is rooted in divine law—is suddenly demoted to a mere “proposal” that may not be “feasible” or “viable” in “the concrete circumstances of the couple.”\nA valid annulment of a truly invalid marriage, the sine qua non for entering into marital relations with another purported spouse, is now dispensed with in “more complex circumstances… when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity,” the way thus being opened to de facto divorce in the Catholic Church.\nThe meaningless slogan “journey of discernment” cloaks a naked authorization for the official toleration of adulterous sexual relations in the Church’s sacramental life.\nNo less than a Roman Pontiff lends his name to the outrageous claim that children resulting from an adulterous relationship, blithely referred to as a “new union,” could be “damaged” if the partners in adultery were required to cease their adultery in order to be absolved and receive Holy Communion—evidently because the “new union” would dissolve without adulterous sexual relations and there could be a second divorce!\nThis appeared in the last Print-Edition of The Remnant.\nSee what else you missed.\nSubscribe Today!\nAs recently as seventeen years ago, during the reign of John Paul II, the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative texts reaffirmed the immutable truth reflected in Canon 915, which prohibits the administration of Holy Communion to those “who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin.” That prohibition, declared the Pontifical Council, applies to the divorced and “remarried” not as a matter of mere disciplinary law subject to revocation or modification, but rather “is derived from divine law and transcends the domain of positive ecclesiastical laws; [and] the latter cannot introduce legislative changes which would oppose the doctrine of the Church.”\nFrancis, however, has purported to do nothing less invent exceptions to divine law that oppose the doctrine of the Church.\nThe attempt is void, of course, and the appellation “authentic Magisterium” is fraudulent.\nBut the consequences of this Pope’s toying with the teaching office of the Church to advance half-baked theological notions, such as “discernment” (a term he borrows from St. Ignatius of Loyola but strips of its original meaning) are catastrophic.\nOver the past year, Cardinal Burke and a few other members of the hierarchy have called upon Francis to “clarify” his intention respecting AL.\nThat clarification has now been given: Francis intends, if it were possible, to change the unchangeable teaching of the Church regarding an irrevocable moral norm rooted in divine law.\nEven if the attempt is void and of no effect before man and God—an immoral law is no law at all—Francis clearly means to impose his will by fiat, daring invoke the “authentic Magisterium” to cloak his absurd novelties.\nNo Pope before him has ever dared to do such a thing.\nSo now it must be asked: Where are the cardinals and the bishops?\nWith one or two noble (however inconsistent) exceptions, their response to the Bergoglian Debacle thus far ranges from silence, to active complicity, to—at best—hand-wringing over the increasingly chaotic state of the Church while begging the Pope to “clarify” his already perfectly clear intentions.\nAt this point, continued pleading for a Bergoglian “clarification” can only give rise to an impression of disingenuousness, whereas continued silence about the papal origin of this ongoing catastrophe is a standing rebuke to all the hierarchs who know what we all know: that at the epicenter of the chaos is the most wayward Pope the Church has ever had to endure.\nContinued inaction while the laity and a few good priests are left to themselves to defend, as best they can, the constant teaching of the Church against the abuses of a tyrant on the Chair of Peter threatens the hierarchs with a legacy of shame and a terrible accountability before the Just Judge.\nTheir failure to defend the Faith by standing up to the one they know full well is attacking it almost daily lends itself ever more to an indictment for timidity in the face of unprecedented danger to the Church and the cause of the Gospel of which they are divinely charged to be leaders.\nThe time for “prudence” is long past.\nPrudence now gives way to mere pusillanimity.\nThe time for hierarchical action is now, before the damage to the Church becomes irreparable.\nThe members of a hierarchy seemingly cowed by a papal tyranny the Church has never before seen must rise immediately and give a courageous answer to the challenge posed long ago by Monsignor Klaus Gamber, when an already monumental ecclesial crisis was still in what can now can be seen as merely a preliminary stage:\nWhere in our Church are the leaders who can show us the right path?\nWhere are the bishops courageous enough to cut out the cancerous growth of modernist theology that has implanted itself and is festering within the celebration of even the most sacred mysteries, before the cancer spreads and causes even greater damage?\nWhat we need today is a new Athanasius, a new Basil, bishops like those who in the fourth century fought courageously against Arianism when almost the whole of Christendom had succumbed to heresy.\nWill none of the hierarchs rise to defend the Church as “a new Athanasius, a new Basil”?\nEven the best among them continue to limit themselves to generalized lamentations at conferences or in interviews about the parlous state of the Church or at most the “confusion” Francis has caused by not “clarifying” precisely what he has just clarified.\nThey avoid the absolutely necessary direct and public exposure of error at its source.\nThat error threatens to overwhelm the Church while they do little more than fret about a situation whose self-evident cause—a reckless Pope in love with his own ideas and filled with contempt for Tradition—they seem incapable of identifying.\nConcerned clergy and laity throughout the Catholic world are doing what they can according to their stations.\nBut in the midst of that “final battle” over marriage and family of which Sister Lucia warned the late Cardinal Caffarra in light of the Third Secret of Fatima, within the human element of the Church only the cardinals and the bishops possess the divinely bestowed power to repel an assault on marriage, family and the very integrity of the Faith that is now, for the first time in Church history, being led by a Roman Pontiff.\nThis undeniably apocalyptic development imposes upon the hierarchs—first and foremost in the Church—the duty to act.\nTrue love for the Church, indeed true charity toward Francis himself, requires of them nothing less than what was required of Saint Paul when the first Pope fell into error that jeopardized the very mission of the Church: that Peter be withstood to his face (Gal.\n2:11).\nMay Our Lady of Fatima intercede to obtain for them the grace of fortitude to do what must be done and what only they can do.\nOur hopes and prayers are with them as the foremost instruments of divine providence in the ecclesia Dei adflicta.\nOur Lady of Fatima, intercede for us!\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ\n\nArchbishop Viganò has released a new, powerful statement necessitated by the peculiar reaction of Pope Francis to the Aug 22 Testimony.\nMany thanks to our friends at LifeSiteNews, especially Diane Montagna, for the following translation and release of the follow-up testimony from arguably the most courageous prelate in the Church today—Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò.\nThe former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States has, as they say, doubled down.\nFar from backing-away and making excuses for his early actions, as we’ve all become so accustomed to seeing in these rare cases where a hierarch breaks ranks, Archbishop Viganò is digging in with a 4-page bombshell that restates his initial accusations of abuse cover-up against Francis and other powerful members of the hierarchy, and even concludes with a suggestion that Francis is beginning to act as a “substitute of our Lord.”\nRead the Archbishop’s words for yourselves and note well the ring of truth that resonates in every sentence.\nThis is clearly the testimony of an honest man who has only the good of the Church in his heart—a modern-day Athanasius standing against something so much worse than Liberius.\nFriends, let us pray for Archbishop Viganò.\nHe is standing alone now, and not only against the most dangerous pontificate in history, but also the forces of hell itself—forces which will do all in their power to silence this voice crying in the wilderness.\nMake no mistake about this: Archbishop Viganò is fighting for the very survival of the human element of the Catholic Church.\nHe is standing against corrupt men in high places who cannot be trusted to do what is best for souls, for the Catholic faithful or indeed for Holy Mother Church herself.\nThe enemy is not only at the gates but has now made their way to the thrones of power and the seats of the Apostles.\nGod help us.\nIt goes without saying that we here at The Remnant not only stand with Viganò but we thank God for him every day, we pray the Rosary for him every day, and wish him every blessing and heavenly consolation as he undergoes this passion for the sake of the Master he serves so well.\nGod bless you, Your Excellency, and Mary keep you.\nWe are with you!\nMJM\n_________________________________\nTit.\nArchbishop of Ulpiana\nApostolic Nuncio\nScio Cui credidi\n(2 Tim 1:12)\nBefore starting my writing, I would first of all like to give thanks and glory to God the Father for every situation and trial that He has prepared and will prepare for me during my life.\nAs a priest and bishop of the holy Church, spouse of Christ, I am called like every baptized person to bear witness to the truth.\nBy the gift of the Spirit who sustains me with joy on the path that I am called to travel, I intend to do so until the end of my days.\nOur only Lord has addressed also to me the invitation, “Follow me!”, and I intend to follow him with the help of his grace until the end of my days.\n“As long as I have life, I will sing to the Lord,\nI will sing praise to my God while I have being.\nMay my song be pleasing to him;\nFor I rejoice in the Lord.”\n(Psalm 103:33-34)\n*****\nIt has been a month since I offered my testimony, solely for the good of the Church, regarding what occurred at the audience with Pope Francis on June 23, 2013 and regarding certain matters I was given to know in the assignments entrusted to me at the Secretariat of State and in Washington, in relation to those who bear responsibility for covering up the crimes committed by the former archbishop of that capital.\nMy decision to reveal those grave facts was for me the most painful and serious decision that I have ever made in my life.\nI made it after long reflection and prayer, during months of profound suffering and anguish, during a crescendo of continual news of terrible events, with thousands of innocent victims destroyed and the vocations and lives of young priests and religious disturbed.\nThe silence of the pastors who could have provided a remedy and prevented new victims became increasingly indefensible, a devastating crime for the Church.\nWell aware of the enormous consequences that my testimony could have, because what I was about to reveal involved the successor of Peter himself, I nonetheless chose to speak in order to protect the Church, and I declare with a clear conscience before God that my testimony is true.\nChrist died for the Church, and Peter, Servus servorum Dei, is the first one called to serve the spouse of Christ.\nCertainly, some of the facts that I was to reveal were covered by the pontifical secret that I had promised to observe and that I had faithfully observed from the beginning of my service to the Holy See.\nBut the purpose of any secret, including the pontifical secret, is to protect the Church from her enemies, not to cover up and become complicit in crimes committed by some of her members.\nI was a witness, not by my choice, of shocking facts and, as the Catechism of the Catholic Church states (par.\n2491), the seal of secrecy is not binding when very grave harm can be avoided only by divulging the truth.\nOnly the seal of confession could have justified my silence.\nNeither the pope, nor any of the cardinals in Rome have denied the facts I asserted in my testimony.\n“Qui tacet consentit” surely applies here, for if they deny my testimony, they have only to say so, and provide documentation to support that denial.\nHow can one avoid concluding that the reason they do not provide the documentation is that they know it confirms my testimony?\nThe center of my testimony was that since at least June 23, 2013, the pope knew from me how perverse and evil McCarrick was in his intentions and actions, and instead of taking the measures that every good pastor would have taken, the pope made McCarrick one of his principal agents in governing the Church, in regard to the United States, the Curia, and even China, as we are seeing these days with great concern and anxiety for that martyr Church.\nNow, the pope’s reply to my testimony was: “I will not say a word!” But then, contradicting himself, he has compared his silence to that of Jesus in Nazareth and before Pilate, and compared me to the great accuser, Satan, who sows scandal and division in the Church — though without ever uttering my name.\nIf he had said: “Viganò lied,” he would have challenged my credibility while trying to affirm his own.\nIn so doing he would have intensified the demand of the people of God and the world for the documentation needed to determine who has told the truth.\nInstead, he put in place a subtle slander against me — slander being an offense he has often compared to the gravity of murder.\nIndeed, he did it repeatedly, in the context of the celebration of the most Holy Sacrament, the Eucharist, where he runs no risk of being challenged by journalists.\nWhen he did speak to journalists, he asked them to exercise their professional maturity and draw their own conclusions.\nBut how can journalists discover and know the truth if those directly involved with a matter refuse to answer any questions or to release any documents?\nThe pope’s unwillingness to respond to my charges and his deafness to the appeals by the faithful for accountability are hardly consistent with his calls for transparency and bridge building.\nMoreover, the pope’s cover-up of McCarrick was clearly not an isolated mistake.\nMany more instances have recently been documented in the press, showing that Pope Francis has defended homosexual clergy who committed serious sexual abuses against minors or adults.\nThese include his role in the case of Fr.\nJulio Grassi in Buenos Aires, his reinstatement of Fr.\nMauro Inzoli after Pope Benedict had removed him from ministry (until he went to prison, at which point Pope Francis laicized him), and his halting of the investigation of sex abuse allegations against Cardinal Cormac Murphy O’Connor.\nIn the meantime, a delegation of the USCCB, headed by its president Cardinal DiNardo, went to Rome asking for a Vatican investigation into McCarrick.\nCardinal DiNardo and the other prelates should tell the Church in America and in the world: did the pope refuse to carry out a Vatican investigation into McCarrick’s crimes and of those responsible for covering them up?\nThe faithful deserve to know.\nI would like to make a special appeal to Cardinal Ouellet, because as nuncio I always worked in great harmony with him, and I have always had great esteem and affection towards him.\nHe will remember when, at the end of my mission in Washington, he received me at his apartment in Rome in the evening for a long conversation.\nAt the beginning of Pope Francis’ pontificate, he had maintained his dignity, as he had shown with courage when he was Archbishop of Québec.\nLater, however, when his work as prefect of the Congregation for Bishops was being undermined because recommendations for episcopal appointments were being passed directly to Pope Francis by two homosexual “friends” of his dicastery, bypassing the Cardinal, he gave up.\nHis long article in L’Osservatore Romano, in which he came out in favor of the more controversial aspects of Amoris Laetitia, represents his surrender.\nYour Eminence, before I left for Washington, you were the one who told me of Pope Benedict’s sanctions on McCarrick.\nYou have at your complete disposal key documents incriminating McCarrick and many in the curia for their cover-ups.\nYour Eminence, I urge you to bear witness to the truth.\n*****\nFinally, I wish to encourage you, dear faithful, my brothers and sisters in Christ: never be despondent!\nMake your own the act of faith and complete confidence in Christ Jesus, our Savior, of Saint Paul in his second Letter to Timothy, Scio cui credidi, which I choose as my episcopal motto.\nThis is a time of repentance, of conversion, of prayers, of grace, to prepare the Church, the bride of the Lamb, ready to fight and win with Mary the battle against the old dragon.\n>","completion":"

for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.\nWherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.\nFor for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.\nRender therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.\nThe first Scripture says:\nLet every soul be subject unto the higher powers.\nFor there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.\nGod ordained the power, and that “rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.\"\nDid God tell His Church to submit to that which He condemns?\n(Deuteronomy 25:1; Proverbs 17:15) Absolutely not!\nIs the Church to transgress His Laws, or to magnify and enforce His Laws unto judgment?\n(Psalm 40:8; Romans 3:31) Of course not!\nIf He did, that would make God unjust.\nJesus said, \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil” (Matthew 5:17).\nThe Lord has, in fact, commanded nowhere in Scripture for the Church to submit to the wicked.\nThe Bible teaches just the exact opposite.\nWe are to “have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them” (Ephesians 5:11).\nFurthermore, it would contradict what Scripture teaches us from Genesis all the way to Revelation every step of the way.\nThink of this: Those that serve “We the People,” before taking office, swear to uphold the US Constitution with their hand on the Holy Bible.\nThey are appointed to magnify law against crime, not crime against the law (Psalm 94:20).\nAmerica is based on Common Law, the Mosaic Institution.\nRead the 5 books of Moses.\n“No enactment of man can be considered law unless it conforms to the Law of God.” –William Blackstone, English Common Law\nRepresentatives are to magnify the law, not tear it down; and yet, this is what the biblically illiterate are teaching others to do, submit to the tyrants and resist God, His Church and His Word (Micah 3:5).\nI ask, are Christians to submit to those who have sanctioned the murder of the innocent in the womb (Exodus 20:13; Proverbs 6:17)?\nAbsolutely not!\nAre Christians to submit to those who have redefined marriage where a man can now \"marry\" a man and a woman can now \"marry\" a woman (Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:24 etc…)?\nAbsolutely not!\nSubmit to those who lie continuously, to them that steal and even kill?\nAbsolutely not!\nSubmit to what God condemns?\nYet, this is what the perverse, modern-day, professing Christians are teaching the sheep in the American Church today.\nIt would do you well to now look to the Christ when He said that we are to beware of the leaven of the Pharisee’s (corrupt doctrines of those who claimed to be the children of God), as well as the leaven of Herod (corrupt doctrines of government) (Mark 8:15).\nIf you remember, it was those same people who called for the crucifixion of Christ while crying out “We have no King but Caesar” (John 19:15).\nDo these that teach such heresy not realize that every apostle, except John, was killed by hostile corrupt civil authorities opposed to their endeavors?\nChristians throughout history were imprisoned, tortured, or killed by corrupt civil authorities of all stripes for refusing to submit to their various, lawless policies and prohibitions.\nDid Christian martyrs violate God’s principles of submission to authority?\nOf course, not.\nAlso, keep in mind that magistrates have limited and defined authority in civil matters.\nTake note that civil government is to be, and must be, a “terror to good works.” It has no power or authority to terrorize good works or good, law-abiding people.\nGod never gave them that authority and any, and all, government that oversteps the divine authority and its boundaries has no divine authority or protection.\nCivil government is a “minister for God to thee for good” (Romans 13:4).\nIt is not a minister of God for evil.\nCivil magistrates have a divine duty to “execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.” Anyone who teaches that they have authority to execute wrath upon \"him that doeth good” is ignorant and uneducated in their misleadings (1 John 4:6).\nTo tell Christians to submit to evil civil authority is teaching the opposite of what is true.\nCommon sense does come into play here.\nI ask, did Moses violate God's principle of submission when he was commanded by God, “Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me” (Exodus 9:1).\nAnd when Pharaoh refused, God plagued the Pharaoh and the Egyptians and set His children free.\nThink of this, the meekest man alive was sent to the face of the Pharaoh to tell him to obey or else.\nIs this what is being preached from the pulpits across America today?\nOr what of Gideon who was to deliver the Children of Israel from the Midianites?\nThe first thing the Lord commanded him to do was to tear down his father's altars (Judges 6:25).\nWas this a violation of God's principles of submission?\nThe sins of the fathers were the reason the Midianites had power to oppress them.\nWhat of that lone prophet, Elijah?\nThe tyrant Ahab called him the troubler of Israel.\nElijah set the record straight when he answered, \"I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim (1 Kings 18:18).\nIs this a violation of God's principles when it came to submission to authority?\nElijah took Ahab and the false prophets to the top of Mount Carmel where the God of Israel consumed the sacrifice by fire, and the false prophets were killed (1 Kings 18:38-40).\nWhat of King David?\nWas he violating God’s principles of submission when he refused to surrender himself to Saul’s troops?\nDavid was a king that was to overthrow corrupt governments by dispossessing them and establishing righteousness through justice and judgment (Jeremiah 23:5; Isaiah 51:4).\nDid Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego violate God's principle of submission when they refused to worship King Nebuchadnezzar’s image?\nThen the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\nThen an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,\nThat at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:\nAnd whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.\nDaniel 3:3-6\nWhen they refused to submit to the tyrant, the furnace was heated up 7 times hotter so that the guards were consumed, only to have the fourth man, “like the Son of man,” show up to deliver them where the fire had no power over them, and not a hair of their heads was singed.\nIn the end, Only the corrupt king acknowledges the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.\n“Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.” Daniel 3:28\nDid Daniel violate God's principles of submission when he disobeyed the king's order to stop praying to any god but himself?\nKeep in mind that the punishment was that Daniel was thrown into a den of lions in which God sent forth an angel to protect him.\nHis accusers were then thrown into the den and devoured by the very lions that they meant to have devoured Daniel (Daniel 6).\nWhat of Jeremiah?\nWas he violating God's principles of submission when he was sent to preach repentance to the corrupt church and the corrupt kings?\nFor, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.\nJeremiah 1:18\nDon’t forget about Amos, who was prophesying judgment upon the corrupt priests and the corrupt king of his day (Amos 7:10-16).\nWas that violating, or fulfilling God's principles and purposes?\nWhat of the New Testament?\nJohn the Baptist points out all of the evils of King Herod (Luke 3:19).\nWas this a violation of submission to civil government?\nNo, it was a rebuke to corruption in government to submit to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and His laws.\nIs it a violation of submission to God's principles to keep preaching, “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins…”?\nAbsolutely not!\nThe corrupt Pharisees along with corrupt government did the opposite.\n“Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.\nAnd they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.\nHowbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.\nAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.\nAnd when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?\nThen Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,\nIf we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;\nBe it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.\nThis is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.\nNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\nNow when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.\nAnd beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.\nBut when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,\nSaying, What shall we do to these men?\nfor that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.\nBut that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.\nAnd they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.\nBut Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.\nFor we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.” Acts 4:2-20\nOr what of the account found in Acts 12:1-11, where the Lord sent an Angel to liberate Peter from the hands of tyrants.\n“Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.\nAnd he killed James the brother of John with the sword.\nAnd because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also.\n(Then were the days of unleavened bread.)\nAnd when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.\nPeter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.\nAnd when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.\nAnd, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly.\nAnd his chains fell off from his hands.\nAnd the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals.\nAnd so he did.\nAnd he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.\nAnd he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.\nWhen they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.\nAnd when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.”\nOver and over again, you can see that the Church was to stand in protest against the wicked that were at war with Christ (Revelation 12:17), in dealing with not only the corrupt and wicked priests, but also the corrupt and wicked in government.\nas well as those who submitted to such.\nIt is important for people to know the Scriptures (History), lest you find yourselves to be fighting against God (Acts 5:39).\nNowhere in Scripture can you find the Lord telling His children to submit to the wicked in disobedience to His Word.\nNowhere!\nFurthermore, the individual that wrote the article teaching people to submit to authorities might want to take the time to read Romans 12:21 before perverting and twisting Romans 13, so that the next time he will not be guilty of twisting Scripture the way that Satan twists Scripture.\n“Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.”\nArticle posted with permission from Sons Of Liberty Media\n>","completion":" Slogans|2131|2153\nSlogans|2194|2234\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|3850|3981\nDoubt|6376|6475\nDoubt|6523|6654\nLoaded_Language|152|169\nName_Calling,Labeling|302|342\nLoaded_Language|46|63\nDoubt|617|726\nDoubt|847|1053\nName_Calling,Labeling|1777|1799\nRepetition|1954|1965\nSlogans|2032|2073\nAppeal_to_Authority|2382|2453\nName_Calling,Labeling|2833|2855\nName_Calling,Labeling|3016|3032\nDoubt|3176|3248\nSlogans|3446|3498\nName_Calling,Labeling|4291|4364\nLoaded_Language|5036|5050\nLoaded_Language|5166|5179\nLoaded_Language|5528|5556\nRepetition|5764|5777\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|6047|6125\nName_Calling,Labeling|6248|6273\nName_Calling,Labeling|6311|6322\nLoaded_Language|6507|6521\nLoaded_Language|6692|6706\nName_Calling,Labeling|6411|6475\nName_Calling,Labeling|6551|6654\nName_Calling,Labeling|6718|6778\nRepetition|6718|6723\nName_Calling,Labeling|6843|6890\nName_Calling,Labeling|6904|6913\nName_Calling,Labeling|7104|7123\nLoaded_Language|7293|7303\nLoaded_Language|7361|7378\nName_Calling,Labeling|7438|7471\nName_Calling,Labeling|7570|7610\nLoaded_Language|7762|7776\nName_Calling,Labeling|7922|7945\nName_Calling,Labeling|8004|8028\nLoaded_Language|8340|8378\nLoaded_Language|8428|8467\nDoubt|8381|8516\nName_Calling,Labeling|8563|8583\nName_Calling,Labeling|8796|8823\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|9049|9076\nName_Calling,Labeling|8991|9012\nName_Calling,Labeling|9526|9548\nName_Calling,Labeling|9499|9509\nName_Calling,Labeling|9707|9715\nRepetition|9774|9803\nLoaded_Language|10767|10778\nRepetition|11198|11208\nName_Calling,Labeling|11459|11475\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|11044|11152\nName_Calling,Labeling|12645|12685\nRepetition|12649|12656\nLoaded_Language|12833|12849\nLoaded_Language|13214|13228\nName_Calling,Labeling|13230|13251\nName_Calling,Labeling|13263|13281\nName_Calling,Labeling|14096|14112\nName_Calling,Labeling|14660|14686\nName_Calling,Labeling|15678|15685\nName_Calling,Labeling|17418|17457\nName_Calling,Labeling|17503|17533\nName_Calling,Labeling|17544|17580\nRepetition|17519|17525\nDoubt|17874|18158\nFlag-Waving|1575|1723\nRepetition|6780|6794\nDoubt|6708|6778\nRepetition|17865|17872."}
{"prompt":"Can the Church Defend Herself Against Bergoglio?\n\nFisher is rightly incensed by Bergoglio’s cunning response, “I will not say a single word on this , ” concerning Archbishop Viganò’s damning indictment of Bergoglio’s rehabilitation of the monster once known as Cardinal McCarrick for some five years before adverse worldwide press coverage forced to him to punish that serial homosexual rapist of whose crimes Viganò had personally informed him back in 2013—information of which Bergoglio was clearly already aware at that time, as Viganò testifies.\nI never thought I’d see

Pope Bergoglio with the following headline: “Does Francis know he sounds like an abuser?”\nThe scales have fallen from Fisher’s eyes and now, at last, she sees Bergoglio, however grudgingly, for what he is: a power-mad ecclesiastical tyrant.\n(A tyrant, moreover, who has ascended to the papacy in a manner reminiscent of the ascension of the corrupt Benedict IX, another “disgrace to the Chair of Peter,” following the machinations of a Roman cabal, as I discuss below.)\nQuoth Fisher:\nI have a number of friends who have escaped abusive marriages.\nThey tell me that Pope Francis is sounding more and more like the men who abused them.\nHe’s sounding like the men who hid that abuse from the world, who taught their victims to blame themselves, who used spiritual pressure to persuade them and their families that it would actually be wrong, sinful, to defend themselves.\nJust listen to him.\nAfter responding to a question about Vigano’s very serious accusations, he said point blank, “I will not say a single word on this.”… [F]or the rest of the week and more, he kept up an unmistakable theme of calling for silence, equating silence with holiness, and painting himself as a Christlike victim in his silence.\nThen he says it’s “ugly” to accuse others of sinning.\nThen he suggests that healing and reconciliation will only come if we take a hard look at our own flaws….\nTo the victims of the Church, and to those who love them, it sounds like he is saying, “Who do you think you are?\nI don’t have to explain myself to you.\nYou’re the guilty one.\nYou brought this on yourself.\nIf you want to be loved, then know your place.\nI’m the victim, here, not you.\nIf you know what’s good for you, keep your mouth shut.” This is how abusers talk.\nThey’re not content with power; they have to keep their victims doubting and blaming themselves constantly, so they don’t become a threat.\nWhether Francis knows it or not, this is how he sounds.\nWe can overlook the fig leaf “whether Francis knows it or not…”.\nFisher knows that Francis knows it, even if she still cannot bring herself to say explicitly what should now be apparent to the entire body of the faithful: that Bergoglio’s very presence on the Chair of Peter is a grave threat to the common good of the Church and the integrity of the Faith.\nClick below to Subscribe to The Remnant's YouTube channel!\nYet Fisher maintains a sliver of space for deniability in order to maintain that indispensable distinction between her and those loathsome traditionalists: “I don’t have any ideological reason to want to bring him down.\nI have defended him as long as I could, up until the Chile debacle.\nAnd so I am working as hard as I can not to assume the worst, not to believe that this man who promised so much fresh air is really so intent on slamming doors shut before we find out even worse things hidden inside.\nBut he is not making it easy.\nI am not saying he is an abuser.\nBut he sounds like one.”\nThat is, Fisher was not concerned about Bergoglio’s relentless assault on traditional Catholic teaching and practice—to her, opposition to Francis on that account is just “ideology”—but only his role in covering up sexual abuse by bishops and priests.\nBut why is Fisher still “working hard not to assume the worst” when there is no longer anything to assume as the ever-mounting evidence of malintent has been in plain view for years?\nIndeed, why else did Archbishop Viganò risk everything in order to expose this Pope, even to the extent of revealing matters supposedly within the scope of “the Pontifical secret”?\nOn orders of the Vatican Secretary of State, the Vatican secret police are reportedly scouring the globe in search of Viganò, who has gone into hiding, “in order to prevent more unpredictable damage to the image of Pope Francis and the Holy See on the world stage, but also to ‘prepare the terrain’ for the former apostolic nuncio-turned-whistleblower to be prosecuted” under canon law.\nThe Dictator Pope must destroy his most potent critic thus far.\nEverything depends on it!\nBut it may already be too late to save a regime whose only defense is not truth but raw power.\nAt last count, some 29 bishops have publicly declared Viganò’s allegations against Bergoglio credible and worthy of investigation.\nNow even the distinguished canonist Edward Peters, who is no less than a Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, declares that if Viganò’s allegations are true then Bergoglio must go:\nOf what was said above concerning resignation from Church office in general, what would not apply to a pope, of all office holders, if he, as alleged by Viganò, from the first months of his papacy knowingly protected and favored a cardinal who was [pick a disgusting verb]-ing seminarians?\nBy what possible stretch of the imagination would such an occupant be suited for the Chair of Peter?\nDoes the historical fact that some pretty bad popes held on to office despite committing various offenses justify other popes acting badly in shirking even the minimal gesture of resigning?\nViganò is unquestionably in a position to know, and claims to know, whether his central allegation that Francis’ was covering for McCarrick, big time, for years, is correct.\nBelieving, as he does, that his claims are correct, Viganò, in calling for Francis’ resignation, has done nothing more or less than exercise his right under canon law “to manifest to the sacred pastors [his] opinion on matters which pertain to the good of the Church and to make [his] opinion known to the rest of the Christian faithful…” 1983 CIC 212 § 3.\nI have not called for Francis’ resignation because I do not know (with the degree of certitude that a lawyer seeks) whether Viganò’s key allegations against Francis are substantially true; most assuredly, however, if I reach the conclusion that they are true, I would say, without hesitation, that Francis should resign.\nBergoglio will not, of course, resign.\nHe will cling to power with his last breath in order to carry out the many other acts of ecclesial subversion he clearly has in mind.\nThe only remedies for the plague of Bergoglio are his natural death or deposition.\nYes, deposition.\nCanon212 has linked to an interesting and timely piece on the role of the Synod of Sutri, near Rome, in 1046, which dealt with the problem of three rival claimants to the papacy, each installed by a Roman faction: First, the execrable Benedict IX, mentioned above.\nSecond, the interloper Sylvester III, installed in the Chair of Peter after Benedict had been driven from Rome.\nThird, the well-intentioned but dimwitted Gregory VI, whose election was tainted by a seemingly simoniacal negotiation with Benedict, who had returned to Rome in 1045 and ousted Sylvester, according to which Benedict would receive a generous pension if he resigned the papacy, which Benedict did only to rescind his resignation.\nThe Synod was convoked by Henry III, the German king and soon-to-be-crowned Holy Roman Emperor, a pious and austere Christian and an exponent of the Cluniac spirit of reform.\nThe Synod declared that Benedict IX (who had refused to appear) was deposed notwithstanding his attempt to undo his resignation.\nAs for Sylvester, the Synod declared that he be “stripped of his sacerdotal rank and shut up in a monastery.” Gregory was also declared deposed, either by the act of the Synod itself or by Gregory’s own voluntary resignation in view of the Synod.\nAt Henry III’s designation, the German Bishop of Bamberg became Clement II, but he died after only a year, whereupon Benedict reasserted his claim to the papacy for the third time in 1047, only to be driven from Rome again by Imperial troops in 1048.\nDamasus II, another German bishop designated by Henry, reigned for a mere three weeks before dying, whereupon Pope St. Leo IX succeeded to the papacy, reigning until 1054.\nLeo, as John Rao observes, was the first in a line of Popes who “took charge of the movement of innovative Christian restoration” which included a breaking of the dominance of Roman nobility over papal elections.\n(Rao, Black Legends, 147-148).\nAs the cited article on the Synod of Sutri notes, although the scurrilous Benedict IX objected to his deposition by the Synod, “the Church has always accepted his deposition as valid.\nThe King of Germany then appointed Clement II as Pope, who promptly crowned the King, Holy Roman Emperor.\nBenedict IX, after the death of Clement, claimed the papacy again!\nThe Church to this day recognizes Clement II as a true Pope.”\nMoreover, Benedict IX himself is recognized as a true Pope—a valid but deposed Pope—during three separate periods listed as three distinct pontificates in the canon of Popes.\nThis was possible owing to the lack of any set canonical form for papal elections; a Pope could gain or regain the office by various machinations.\nIndeed, even the Vatican’s own website states that Benedict was Pope from 1047-1048, the very year of his third ascension to the office from which he was finally driven by force.\nOnly with the ascension of Pope Nicholas II in 1059 was it established that henceforth the cardinal-bishops would elect the Pope, with the other cardinals having the right to confirm or veto the nominee.\nBy 1100 what we now know as the College of Cardinals, embracing all the cardinals of different titles, had the exclusive right to elect a Pope, and the members of the College “have held it ever since.” (Eric John, The Popes, 181).\nThese lessons of history should suffice to dispel the pious fable, never a teaching of the Magisterium, that every Pope is chosen by the Holy Ghost to lead the Church.\nThis theological error, which Bergoglio has exploited to the hilt, is a key element in the related error of papalotry, which elevates the person of the Pope above the office he occupies and makes of him the leader of a personality cult everyone is commanded to “love” (in the superficially emotional sense) and obey no matter what he says or does, rather than a custodian and defender of the Deposit of Faith whose lovability, personality and opinions are utterly irrelevant to the exercise and scope of his office.\nAs Pope Benedict has observed, when it comes to the election of a Pope “the Spirit’s role should be understood in a much more elastic sense, not that he [sic] dictates the candidate for whom one must vote….\nThere are too many contrary instances of popes the Holy Spirit obviously would not have picked!” Bergoglio is undeniably one of them.\nSo what can be done to defend the Church against Bergoglio?\nThat the mode of papal election by cardinals has persisted for nearly a thousand years has led to the general impression that it pertains to the irreformable divine constitution of the Church, but it certainly does not.\nAs to matters of purely ecclesiastical law such as this one the Church has always allowed for departures from traditional practice in cases of emergency or grave necessity.\nAnd just as a synod was employed to address three rival claimants to the papal throne in 1046, declaring at least two of them deposed, so today might it be possible for reform-minded cardinals and bishops, comprising an imperfect council, to undo the incalculable damage caused by the cabal that lobbied for Bergoglio’s election before the last conclave—a cabal that included none other than McCarrick, whom Bergoglio rewarded by rehabilitating that monster despite the massive evidence of his unspeakable crimes.\nWhat would be the grounds for a declaration of deposition at such a gathering of prelates?\nOne could readily point to the evidence that a faction that included Bergoglio himself had agreed upon his election before the conclave, and that all those involved, including Bergoglio, were thereby excommunicated latae sententiae in accordance with Article 81 of John Paul II’s Universi Dominici Gregis, which provides:\nThe Cardinal electors shall further abstain from any form of pact, agreement, promise or other commitment of any kind which could oblige them to give or deny their vote to a person or persons.\nIf this were in fact done, even under oath, I decree that such a commitment shall be null and void and that no one shall be bound to observe it; and I hereby impose the penalty of excommunication latae sententiae upon those who violate this prohibition.\nTo quote Cajetan on this point (citations taken from the linked article by Robert Siscoe), deposition by an imperfect council is appropriate “when one or more Popes suffer uncertainty with regard to their election, as seems to have arisen in the schism of Urban VI and others.\nThen, lest the Church be perplexed, those members of the Church who are available have the power to judge which is the true pope, if it can be known, and if it cannot be known, [it has] the power to provide that the electors agree on one or another of them.”\nI am not saying that such a case has been proven.\nRather, what I am saying is that this hypothetical imperfect council could determine that it has been proven and act accordingly, and that the Church would judge any resulting deposition of Bergoglio in the same manner it judges the deposition of Benedict IX.\nAnother ground for deposition—as determined by the imperfect council, not any of us—would be that Bergoglio has deposed himself by promulgating heresy, fracturing the Church’s universal discipline respecting marriage and the Eucharist, and undermining the teaching of even his own immediate predecessors on matters of fundamental morality upheld by the Magisterium for two millennia.\nSurely the Church cannot be without any remedy for a Pope who relentlessly attacks her very foundations!\nTo quote Cajetan again: “Indeed the Church has the right to separate herself from an heretical pope according to divine law.\nConsequently, it has the right, by the same divine law, to use all means of themselves necessary for such separation; and those that juridically correspond to the crime, are of themselves necessary”—meaning the resort to an imperfect council.\nIf a synod was able to declare the deposition of a pope in 1046, why not an imperfect council today—or, for that matter, another synod?\nIt will be argued that such a deposition would provoke massive schisms in the Church.\nBut that would not be the first time that defense of the Church’s common good has done so, as the Great Western Schism demonstrates.\nAnd are we not in the midst of schisms already, provoked by none other than Bergoglio himself, whose insane drive to shatter the Church’s bimillennial discipline has produced the totally unprecedented situation in which what is still considered mortally sinful in one diocese is an imperative of “mercy” in another?\nIn any case, this much is certain: barring Bergoglio’s conversion and reversal of course, the Church cannot abide this pontificate any longer.\nOne way or another, the Church will have to repel an attacker at her very summit.\nEither the human element of the Church will act according to the means which seem possible, however extraordinary, or Heaven itself will intervene in a manner that might well involve a divine chastisement due to the negligence of time-serving pastors who left their sheep completely undefended against the wolves who preyed upon them, including the wolf the cardinals improvidently elected Pope.\nSome four months before Archbishop Viganò’s testimony Cardinal Willem Jacobus Eijk, the Archbishop of Utrecht, Netherlands, perhaps the most liberal territory in the entire Church, protested that Bergoglio’s blatant nod to intercommunion with Protestants in Germany means that “the bishops and, above all, the Successor of Peter fail to maintain and transmit faithfully and in unity the deposit of faith contained in Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture” and that the situation reminds him of Article 675 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which refers to the Church’s “final trial” before the Second Coming, “that will shake the faith of many believers… [a] ‘mystery of iniquity’ in the form of a religious deception offering men an apparent solution to their problems at the price of apostasy from the truth.\nWhat can the Church do when confronted by a Pope who, as a prominent cardinal declares to the whole world, “fail[s] to maintain and transmit faithfully … the deposit of faith contained in Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture” and is leading “an apostasy from the truth”?\nIt seems absurd to argue that she can do nothing but exhort the faithful to pray and do penance while a papal malefactor, treated as if were an absolute dictator, is allowed to continue wreaking havoc upon faith and morals to the detriment of countless souls, without the least impediment, for so long as he shall live.\nNo, Bergoglio must go.\nThe successors of the Apostles, the only ones in a position to end his rampage, must demand his resignation and, should he refuse as expected, act in this unprecedented emergency to declare his removal from the office he has criminally abused and whose very credibility he threatens to destroy.\nMay God give them the grace to do what must be done and what history will vindicate as a rescue of the Church during the height of the worst crisis in her history.\n>","completion":"

them alone and that the number of Jews who died in that Holocaust was six million.\nWhat we have here are historical errors.\nFirst of all, the figure of six million is a historical lie.\nIn addition,

{"prompt":"Kavanaugh and Last-Minute Accusations\n\nDemocrats are pulling out all the stops and enabling salacious last-minute accusations against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh in order to sink his candidacy.\nNow that Christine Blasey Ford has finally agreed to testify this Thursday at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding her charge that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a long-ago high school party, these new charges have suddenly emerged from left field.\nOn Sunday, a former classmate from Judge Kavanaugh's time at Yale accused the Supreme Court nominee of exposing himself to her at a party.\nThe New Yorker has just published an article written by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer, based on information that was reportedly sent to at least four Democratic senators.\nThe article recounted a claim by Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Brett Kavanaugh’s, concerning “a dormitory party gone awry.” As the article acknowledged, however, “her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident.” The article goes on to say that in her initial conversations with The New Yorker, Ms. Ramirez was “reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh’s role in the alleged incident with certainty.” It was only after “six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney” that Ms. Ramirez was suddenly able to pinpoint Judge Kavanaugh as having committed an unsavory act, even though she admitted being “foggy” at the time.\nThe New Yorker article also noted that the magazine “has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party.”\nMeanwhile, the ever-present Michael Avenatti, attorney of porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted that he had information from anonymous sources that Judge Kavanaugh and his friend had \"targeted\" women with drugs and alcohol at parties to facilitate \"gang rape.\"\nHaters of Judge Kavanaugh are turning the process of Senate confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee into something worse than a travesty.\nHis opponents in the Senate have transformed their “advise and consent” function into a campaign of no-holds barred character assassination.\n\nWhile Judge Kavanaugh weathers these latest accusations, which he adamantly denies, his real test will be on Thursday, assuming that Christine Blasey Ford will follow through on her agreement to testify at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nHer attorneys stalled for a week before making the announcement that Ms. Ford would testify despite certain “unresolved” issues.\nAmong the issues Ms. Ford’s attorneys have raised was the refusal of the committee to subpoena one of the purported witnesses, Mark Judge, who Ms. Ford reportedly claims was involved in the alleged incident, as well as “who on the Majority side will be asking the questions, whether senators or staff attorneys.\"\nA week has already gone by since Ms. Ford went public with her story in an interview with the Washington Post while Ms. Ford and her attorneys stalled for time.\nThey raised one procedural issue after another while claiming that the committee majority was “bullying” Ms. Ford.\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-I) has bent over backwards to accommodate Ms. Ford’s preferred scheduling for her appearance.\nHe extended the deadline several times for her to come to a decision on whether to testify at all.\nHe had offered various options for her to testify publicly or privately or to be interviewed by committee staff in her home state of California, whichever setting would make her more comfortable.\nHowever, in Senator Grassley’s e-mail thanking Ms. Ford for finally agreeing to a time certain for her testimony, Senator Grassley correctly reminded her attorneys that “the committee determines which witnesses to call, how many witnesses to call, and what order to call them and who will question them.\nThese are nonnegotiable.”\nWhile the negotiations with Ms. Ford’s attorneys for her testimony were underway, Democrats were sitting on the latest allegations, ready to pounce as soon as Ms. Ford’s accusation was about to be heard.\nSome Democrats are already using the Ramirez episode to push anew for a fresh FBI investigation and to postpone Thursday’s scheduled hearing.\nIdeally, if the Democrats cannot apply enough pressure to force a withdrawal of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination through their relentless campaign of character assassination, they want to push any Senate votes until after the midterm elections at the earliest.\nThen they will claim that the newly elected senators should be involved in the confirmation decision.\nIn the meantime, Judge Kavanaugh’s adversaries in the Senate, the mainstream media and progressive circles continue to bludgeon Judge Kavanaugh in the court of public opinion.\nAll of their stratagems are an obvious attempt to buy time in order to persuade any wavering senators that Judge Kavanaugh is too tainted by sexual assault charges – whether proven or not - to sit on the Supreme Court.\nProof does not matter to those wanting to bring Judge Kavanaugh down at any cost.\nRegarding Ms. Ford’s accusation, they know that the proof so far is non-existent, aside from Ms. Ford’s own assertions contained in her confidential letter given to Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, last July, and in her Washington Post interview.\nWhile a redacted version of Ms. Ford’s letter has been published, Senator Feinstein has refused to date to give even Senator Grassley a copy of the completely unredacted version.\nThe FBI has already conducted 6 background checks, no federal crime is alleged, and there is no forensic evidence to investigate after 30 years at a site that Ms. Ford cannot even identify.\nWhat we do know so far tends to undercut the credibility of Ms. Ford’s accusation.\nMs. Ford cannot corroborate her decades-old charge of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh.\nWhatever corroboration Ms. Ford was hoping for from “witnesses” she claimed were at the alleged party is non-existent.\nThe individuals she reportedly named in her unredacted confidential letter given to Senator Feinstein have either denied being at such a party or do not recollect what Ms. Ford has alleged.\nMoreover, by her own admission to the Washington Post, Ms. Ford “said she does not remember some key details of the incident.” She does not remember, for example, where it happened, how the party came together in the first place, or how she got home after the alleged incident.\nShe believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, but reportedly could not be more precise on the day or even the month of the party.\nAfraid that Ms. Ford’s sexual assault allegation could be readily challenged and anxious to establish some sort of pattern of sexual misconduct beyond this single alleged incident, the Kavanaugh haters have latched onto Ms. Ramirez’s story.\nThe New York Times published an op-ed column last week by a psychiatrist, Richard A. Friedman, who cited neurological science to conclude that Ms. Ford’s claim that she has “a vivid memory of an attack that took place when she was 15” is “credible.” The reason, he wrote, is that “memories formed under the influence of intense emotion — such as the feelings that accompany a sexual assault — are indelible in the way that memories of a routine day are not.” The only problem with Dr. Friedman’s thesis is that Ms. Ford has apparently forgotten such key details surrounding the alleged sexual assault as when and where it happened and how she got home.\nMoreover, when Ms. Ford finally told someone about the incident in any detail some 30 years later in 2012, during a couples therapy session with her husband, she did not name Judge Kavanaugh specifically, according to the therapist’s notes that Ms. Ford had provided to the Washington Post in connection with her interview.\nThe Washington Post reported that the therapist’s notes it reviewed “do not mention Kavanaugh’s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students ‘from an elitist boys’ school’ who went on to become ‘highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.’”\nMs. Ramirez’s story is even less credible.\nIt took an attorney and six days of very belated reflection to help revive her memory of an incident she claimed happened while she herself was very drunk.\nSenator Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), one of Judge Kavanaugh’s fiercest critics who told men to “shut up” regarding Ms. Ford’s allegations, said she doubts Judge Kavanaugh’s credibility because of “how he approaches his cases.” Aside from mischaracterizing the constitutional textualist reasoning underlying Judge Kavanaugh’s opinions, she is saying that she does not believe Judge Kavanaugh’s denial of the sexual misconduct allegations lodged against him because of the opinions he wrote that she does not like.\nSuch circular “reasoning” would be amusing if it were not so emblematic of what one writer called “Kavanaugh Derangement Syndrome.\"\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is also suffering from the same syndrome.\nShe said Thursday regarding Ms. Ford: \"I believe her because she is telling the truth and you know it by her story.\"\nMs. Ford’s supporters are exploiting the “Me Too” movement to declare Judge Kavanaugh guilty simply because Ms. Ford is a woman who has made what they call, without any corroborating evidence to date, a “credible” charge.\nThe same would presumably be the case for Ms. Ramirez.\nThey argue that since the Senate Judiciary Committee is not a criminal judicial trial, but rather a legislative hearing for confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee, the normal burden of proof shouldered by the accuser should not apply.\nJudge Kavanaugh should have to prove that he is not guilty, they are in effect insisting.\nThis is another case of Kavanaugh Derangement Syndrome.\nLet’s assume for the sake of argument that the normal burden on the prosecution in a criminal case - to prove the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt - is not applicable regarding the charge against Judge Kavanaugh since he is not a defendant in a criminal trial.\nHowever, that should not flip the burden of proof onto Judge Kavanaugh altogether.\nJudge Kavanaugh is being subjected to charges of a criminal nature that could not only deprive him of a seat on the Supreme Court for which he is otherwise eminently qualified.\nMs. Ford’s unsubstantiated accusation can completely destroy Judge Kavanaugh’s life by causing irreparable damage to his reputation for integrity and good character and to his career, which he has built up during decades of public service.\nHis family’s lives have been completely upended.\nPlacing the burden on Judge Kavanaugh to prove that he was not involved in an uncorroborated incident from years ago, about which even his accuser does not recall key details, turns the fundamental constitutional principle of due process upside down.\nMs. Ford should have the burden to prove her accusations by at least a preponderance of all the evidence presented.\nThis charade must come to an end.\nNo more extensions for Ms. Ford to come forward and testify.\nIf Ms. Ford does not follow through with her agreement to testify in an open Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this Thursday and do so upon the conditions set by the committee, she should go home while the committee proceeds to an immediate vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination.\nIf Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh do testify, the senators deciding on whether to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as well as the American public following the testimony must remember one cardinal rule.\nIn a nation guided by fairness and law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.\nSadly, many of Judge Kavanaugh’s haters have thrown that rule aside.\nIf Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination is pulled as a result of the smears and character assassination, President Trump should immediately nominate someone on his short list such as Amy Coney Barrett and the Senate Republican majority should then push through the new nominee’s confirmation as soon as possible.\nDelay is not an option.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|3212|3231\nLoaded_Language|11058|11070\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2009|2030\nExaggeration,Minimisation|10444|10485\nLoaded_Language|53|78\nLoaded_Language|459|491\nName_Calling,Labeling|1894|1919\nSlogans|2148|2171\nLoaded_Language|4056|4071\nRepetition|4416|4439\nLoaded_Language|4736|4756\nName_Calling,Labeling|6861|6881\nName_Calling,Labeling|8063|8083\nSlogans|8985|9015\nName_Calling,Labeling|9255|9271\nCausal_Oversimplification|9306|9433\nRepetition|9840|9870\nRepetition|11722|11746\nSlogans|11848|11871\nLoaded_Language|11837|11843\nDoubt|5762|5843\nDoubt|5939|6056\nDoubt|7380|7572\nDoubt|8517|8597\nAppeal_to_Authority|9135|9210\nFlag-Waving|10867|10940\nFlag-Waving|11625|11705."}
{"prompt":"Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran\n\nOften, the American mainstream media becomes a de facto government employee, taking the claims of U.S. officials and reporting them as proven fact — and nothing exemplifies this penchant better than reporting on the Gulf of Tonkin incident — perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up as a justification for war.\nOn August 5, 1964, the New York Times reported, “President Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and ‘certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam’ after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.” Additional outlets, such as the Washington Post, echoed this claim.\nBut it wasn’t true.\nAt all.\nIn fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam — leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese, fomenting the largest anti-war movement in American history, and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\n* Yes, he will be confirmed.\nNo, he will not be confirmed.\nEmail *\nPhone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nIn 2010, more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released, proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House.\nBut while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn’t be disputed.\nTom Wells, author of the exhaustive exposé “The War Within: America’s Battle Over Vietnam,” explained the media egregiously erred in “almost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information” and “reluctance to question official pronouncements on ‘national security issues.’”\nIf due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it’s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did.\nSadly, the United States has a tendency to repeat the same mistakes over and over again.\nAnd now, a US Army Colonel is predicting that another Gulf of Tonkin incident could bring us into war with Iran.\nAs President Donald Trump continues to surround himself with neocon warhawks, the drums are beating for war with Iran.\nThe rhetoric is becoming so strong, that Trump himself — without provocation — began tweeting threats to the sovereign nation.\nOn Tuesday, Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Colonel Douglas Macgregor addressed the growing prospect of US war with Iran and warned that a new “Gulf of Tonkin incident” could be used to drag us into it.\nCarlson mocked the neocons’ claims that Iran is the “greatest threat” to America, explicitly noting that “virtually every attack in America has been inspired not by Iran, but by Iran’s Sunni enemies.”\nCarlson pointed out how the neocons are hellbent on pushing the Trump administration into a new war.\n“If there was ever a swamp in Washington you are looking at it — the foreign policy establishment — they are working overtime to ensnare the president in a mess in Iran,” Carlson said.\n“Let’s hope that he understands exactly what’s going on.”\nPointing out Trump’s recent attempts at diplomacy with North Korea and Russia, Col. Macgregor weighed in, noting that he thinks Trump will attempt to avoid war with Iran.\nHowever, he noted that a false flag could be used to drag us into it.\n“I think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident,” Col. Macgregor said.\n“Many of your viewers may not remember that it never happened and we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf.\nWe should watch for that, and this is an example of President Trump’s comments on fake news, he should not be sabotage by fake news.”\nCarlson then pointed out how the Trump admin has reacted to fake news by attacking Syria—twice.\nFor those who may be unaware, the plan to overthrow Iran has long been in the works.\nIn fact, in April 2012, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained (Mojahedin-e Khalq) MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009.\nMEK is the Iranian political-militant organization that advocates for the violent overthrow of the current Iranian regime.\nThey are hardly quiet about it.\nAccording to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009.\nHersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including former CIA directors James Woolsey and Porter Goss; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N.\nAmbassador John Bolton.\nCoincidentally, MEK was classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and its allies—during this training period—until they suddenly removed them from the list in 2012.\nWhile the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom, the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran is outright insane.\nTo see what US intervention—through military support and the support of ‘protesters’—does to countries, one need only look at Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya to see the horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias left in America’s wake.\nTo those paying attention over the years, Trump’s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report.\nThis was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense.\n“This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years,” Clark said.\n“Starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.”\nAll presidents since Clinton have crossed countries off this list.\nNow it’s Trump’s turn.\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|6014|6022\nExaggeration,Minimisation|350|384\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3247|3264\nFlag-Waving|3268|3275\nLoaded_Language|3436|3444\nLoaded_Language|355|368\nExaggeration,Minimisation|743|749\nName_Calling,Labeling|2806|2821\nLoaded_Language|3626|3633\nLoaded_Language|5824|5839\nLoaded_Language|6039|6060."}
{"prompt":"National Data | May Jobs: Displacement Stalls, Americans Take All New Jobs—But For How Long?\n| Articles\n\nFinally, the shocking surge in immigrant displacement of American workers and in the immigrant workforce, which began in January and completely undid the improvement we had begun hopefully to call the “Trump Effect” has stalled.\nMay job numbers released Friday show native-born Americans big winners and immigrants (legal and illegal, the Labor Department doesn’t distinguish) big losers.\nBut displacement and immigrant workforce growth are still high in absolute terms and could resume anytime.\nOnly legislation, above all an immigration moratorium, can secure the fruits of the current economic expansion for Americans.\nIn May:\nImmigrant employment fell by 1.068 million, down by 3.81%.\nNative-born American employment rose by 1.361 million—up 1.1%\nThe immigrant employment index, set to 100.0 in January 2009, fell to 124.7 from 129.6 in April.\nThe native-born American employment index rose to 106.6 from 105.4 in April.\nThe New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index (NVDAWDI), our term for the ratio of immigrant to native-born employment growth indexes, fell to 117.0 from the all-time high,123.0, recorded in April.\nCan't render, error\nIn other words, Trump has not even begun to repair the damage done by eight years of Obama.\nNative-born American workers lost ground to their foreign-born competitors throughout the Obama years.\nAnd, shown above, this trend accelerated significantly in the months leading up to the election.\nWhile May was a welcome respite, Trump supporters have reason to complain: Since taking office in January 2017 President Trump has presided over a labor market in which immigrants have gained 1.006 million jobs, a 3.9% increase, while native-born Americans gained about 2.4 million jobs —a rise of only 1.9%.\nAs far as the labor market is concerned, “America First” has not translated to Americans First.\nIn normal times, this might be a big story.\nBut the even the conservative non-Main Stream Media is currently too steeped in economic euphoria to notice.\nNd anyway, they almost never report the immigration dimension.\nHowever, it is now absolutely clear that immigration, and immigrant displacement of American workers, cannot be jawboned away.\nThe only answer is legislation— border wall to stop the illegal alien flow; a second Operation Wetback, including E-Verify, to get the illegal alien self-deporting; a moratorium on legal immigration.\nMay 2018 was the fifth consecutive month in which the foreign-born working age population (including illegals) grew by more than 1 million from the same month the prior year.\nBut May’s growth was less than that in April and March, possibly an emerging trend.\nCan't render, error\nIn May 2018 there were 1.342 million more working-age immigrants than in May 2017.\nThis comes on the heels of gains of 2.154 million and 1.597 million.\nyear-over-year, in March and April, respectively.\nIt’s hard to believe with the evaporation of the Trump Effect, but less than six months ago we were seeing to year-over-year declines in the immigrant workforce population.\nThe last five months of 2017 saw the foreign-born population fall by an average 100,000 from the same month of the prior year (shown in red on our chart).\nThese are net figures.\nOver a 12-month period an average of perhaps 300,000 immigrants die and an equal number leave the U.S. voluntarily.\nSo the 1.342 million net rise in foreign-born population, May 2017 to May 2018, implies that nearly 2 million foreign-born individuals may have actually settled in the country over those 12 months.\n(This excludes tourists and other short-term entrants.)\nIn percentage terms, the immigrant working-age population grew 3.24% over the 12 months.\nIf this growth rate persists, it portends a doubling in 22 years.\nBy contrast, the native-born American population rose 0.63% over this period —a rate that will require 114 years for a doubling.\nIf both rates persist that long, the term “native born” will refer to a minuscule fraction of the U.S. population.\nAnother way of looking at American worker displacement: the immigrant share of total U.S. employment:\nCan't render, error\nImmigrants accounted for 17.36% of total employment in May.\nNote that, while significantly below the all-time high of 18.1% recorded in April, the May figure is third highest among the 113 months for which we have data.\nA detailed snapshot of American worker displacement over the past year is available in the Employment Status of the Civilian Population by Nativity table published in the monthly BLS Report.\nEmployment Status by Nativity, May 2017- May 2018 (numbers in 1000s;

{"prompt":"MSM Using Kavanaugh Sex Scandal to Distract You From Real Reason He Shouldn’t Be Confirmed\n\nIn July, President Donald Trump nominated D.C.\nCircuit Court of Appeals Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\nSince then, there have been numerous allegations of sexual misconduct levied toward the Justice to be.\nWhether or not he is guilty of these allegations is left to be determined.\nHowever, it does serve as a great distraction from his actual constitution-hating and tyrannical tendencies.\nWhile Kavanaugh may be an ostensible supporter of the Second Amendment, his record indicates that he all but cannot stand the Fourth and he’s not that big a fan of the First either.\nWhile the allegations against Kavanaugh should certainly be investigated — no matter how they are being spun by the left and the right — he shouldn’t even be in this position based solely on his previous record.\nBut no one is talking about this.\nInstead, the left and right are involved in a mudslinging orgy of victim shaming and kangaroo courts.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\n* John Bolton Richard Grenell Dina Powell Heather Nauert Ivanka Trump\nEmail *\nComments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nAccording to this Supreme Court nominee, he thinks it is just fine and dandy for police and government to track you, spy on you, and dig through your personal life — without a warrant.\nOn multiple occasions, Kavanaugh has been the lone voice when it comes supporting the state’s rights to warrantlessly spy on its citizens.\nAs Reason points out, in 2010 he dissented from the D.C. Circuit’s decision not to rehear a case in which a three-judge panel had ruled that police violated a suspected drug dealer’s Fourth Amendment rights when they tracked his movements for a month by attaching a GPS device to his car without a warrant.\nKavanaugh claimed that putting a GPS tracking device on a person’s car without first obtaining a warrant was just fine because it didn’t constitute a “search” as defined by the Fourth Amendment.\nTo Kavanaugh, bypassing the courts and tracking an individual without their consent is “constitutional.” In this line of thinking, the Fourth Amendment is not violated even if police trespass on someone’s physical property, or track someone’s cell phone.\nLuckily, he was the only judge on the panel to think this.\nIn June, the Supreme Court ruled specifically on this case noting that collecting such information actually does constitute a search and therefore requires a warrant.\nBut it gets worse.\nIn 2015, Kavanaugh issued a statement strongly defending the NSA’s phone metadata collection program, arguing that it is “entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.” To Kavanaugh, sweeping programs that collect information from innocent citizens’ phones are not in conflict with having the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure.\nSeriously.\nAccording to Kavanaugh, the Fourth Amendment allows for searches “without individualized suspicion” when the government demonstrates a “special need” that “outweighs the intrusion on individual liberty.”\nExactly what this “special need” is that can constitute a Gestapo like police state surveilling its own citizens is a moving target that has already been proven to be abused over and over again.\n“The sacrifice of our personal liberty for security is and will forever be a false choice,” Senator Rand Paul said of Kavanaugh’s views on the disposable nature of the constitution.\nKavanaugh “has no qualms about applying decades-old case law to the digital age, and he has endorsed the idea of a “counterterrorism exception” to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement,” said Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program.\nWhile the left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed over the sex abuse allegations and the right is attacking the alleged victims, others in Congress who see through the facade and media distraction are trying to draw attention to the fact that Kavanaugh is a champion of the police and surveillance state and an enemy to privacy.\nRepresentative Justin Amash does not have a vote on whether or not Kavanaugh will be appointed.\nHowever, this hasn’t prevented him from becoming the only Republican to speak out against the real reasons he should not be appointed to Supreme Court.\n“Privacy advocates must fight,” Amash tweeted.\n“There are many potential nominees with a conservative record on abortion, guns, and regulations.\nThe only question is will the Senate confirm one who is really bad on the #4thAmendment, when so much is at stake in upcoming digital privacy battles.”\nIndeed, as technology increases, so does the desire of the state to use it to spy on us.\nThe cases headed to the supreme court in the future over what constitutes an unconstitutional search will undoubtedly be vast in number and detrimental in deciding how much freedom and privacy Americans get to keep.\nAs for if Kavanaugh gets appointed, Amash has some harsh words to those who are blindly supporting him based on party lines:\n“When Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court, undermining our #4thAmendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures, it will be too late for others to join me.”\nBelow is a video taken at the Mises Institute of Judge Napolitano explaining the implications of this enemy of the Fourth Amendment on the Supreme Court.\nJudge Andrew #Napolitano on Brett #Kavanaugh and the #PatriotAct At Mises University, Judge Andrew Napolitano breaks down some of the troubling parts of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's legal career.\nhttps:\/\/law.justia.com\/cases\/federal\/appellate-courts\/cadc\/15-5307\/15-5307-2015-11-20.htmlLong story short, #Kavanaugh is not a friend to civil liberties or the Constitution.\nHe helped to uphold the UnConstitutional Patriot Act which of course paved the way for the Indefinte Detention provisions of the NDAA.\nAuburn, Alabama;

{"prompt":"America's Immigration Voice.\n\nKritarch Patti Saris thinks she runs immigration policy, right down to how many times someone can have their case reviewed, though she seems confused as to who will do the reviewing of those cases.\nAt issue is a large group of Indonesian Chinese Christians who fled a pogrom in Indonesia directed against them in the 1990s.\nThe Chinese generally filed asylum applications after arriving in the United States, and, importantly, not at an American embassy or consulate in Indonesia or nearby.\nAll were relatively wealthy and had or obtained tourist visas to the United States.\nThis is important as most actual \"refugees\" drop everything to flee their homelands if they are under threat of death.\nTellingly, these asylum applicants were the elite of Indonesian society, because their higher average IQ, than the rather dull Indonesians.\n87 is the average Indonesian IQ , and note that average includes the higher average Chinese, so the locals really are a dull lot.\nThis is important in that while there was anti-Chinese and anti-Christian violence, the non-Chinese Christians mostly stuck around, though the Chinese used tourist and student visas to come to the United States in a leisurely manner, taking time to either bring or otherwise secure their wealth in Indonesia.\nIn any event, the persecution was limited in time and duration as the local elite know they need the Chinese to run the economy and to avoid Red China intervening on behalf of their fellow ethnics.\nIn the United States, these Chinese went through the liberal asylum process, but did not manage to fool even the credulous \"judges\" at the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the immigration courts.\nFast forward to the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty , where despite outstanding deportation orders, these illegal aliens, among millions of others, are allowed to remain, and then given employment authorization as well.\nFortunately, elections have consequences, and the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty, or parts of it, came to an inglorious end.\nAnd end it was for this particular lot of illegal aliens.\nBut Kritarch Patti Saris was having none of the immigration laws of the United States.\nShe thought she was decider-in-chief on who gets deported.\nAnd all on the flimsy excuse that the aliens need another bite at the apple, despite the clear fact that the Indonesian government had long ago quashed the ethnic riots directed against the market dominant minority of Chinese and the religious motivated violence against Christians.\nWhile there are a couple of provinces in Indonesia that impose Sharia law on Muslims, most non-Muslims are exempt.\nAs moderates go, Indonesia is about as close as it gets to moderate Muslims.\nMostly because the country would not last long without an outside high IQ elite to run the country.\nBefore it was the high IQ Dutch, now it's the Chinese.\nRemember, an 87 IQ is just about retarded.\nA federal judge on Monday ordered U.S. immigration officials to delay any efforts to deport 51 Indonesians living illegally in New Hampshire so the group can have time to argue that changing conditions in that country would make it dangerous to return... Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts.\nChief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston found she had authority to ensure the Indonesians have a chance to argue that conditions in their home country had deteriorated significantly enough to reopen their cases for trying to stay in the United State.\nShe worried that without the order, ICE officials could deport some of the Indonesians covered by the suit, at which time they would lose the opportunity to have their cases reopened.\n[Judge Orders U.S. To Delay Deporting Indonesians In Immigration Fight, by Scott Malone, Reuters, November 27, 2017]\nKritarch Saris thought she knew better and has been running a deliberate campaign to prevent the deportation of these Chinese illegal aliens.\nAnd now she has gone full rogue, prohibiting the deportation of all these illegal aliens who already had their day in immigration court.Saris appears to be making up immigration law and procedure on the fly, as her order appears to not understand either the EOIR process or immigration law.\n“The government shall inform the court whether petitioners, who are not detained, will have access to emergency procedures if they must file their original motions to reopen,” Saris wrote.\nThis makes no sense in English, much less in the established procedures in the EOIR.\nThe aliens have no emergency, there are no emergency procedures, and their original motions to reopen were denied for lack of legal basis in law or any changed conditions in the country they are being deported to that would avail them of another claim.\nIndonesia is more hospitable to Chinese Christians today than the short period in the 90s when there was a problem.\nBut basically, Saris wants the illegal aliens the opportunity to submit another asylum application, and benefit by the years it will take to adjudicate those claims.\nBasically Saris wants these illegals to never leave.\nThat, of course is not her role.\nThe only claim they have before a Federal court is if they got the due process that Congress gave those illegal aliens.\nAnd they did, they filed for asylum, had a hearing and appeals, and lost.\nWith the legislative fight over DACA, the Trump Administration needs to include legislative language including more restrictions on kritarchs who want to make American immigration policy, as well as other reforms to lower legal immigration, build the wall, and deport illegals here.\nOr impeachment, or both.\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|1610|1632\nRepetition|5284|5298\nCausal_Oversimplification|30|85\nCausal_Oversimplification|724|862\nLoaded_Language|957|992\nName_Calling,Labeling|1444|1453\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|1936|2064\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2231|2268\nLoaded_Language|2320|2345\nCausal_Oversimplification|2760|2843\nLoaded_Language|2910|2941\nLoaded_Language|4002|4025\nLoaded_Language|298|304\nName_Calling,Labeling|839|862\nName_Calling,Labeling|982|992\nLoaded_Language|1600|1631\nLoaded_Language|2050|2060\nName_Calling,Labeling|2933|2941\nRepetition|2308|2314\nRepetition|3978|3992\nRepetition|4068|4082\nRepetition|4563|4569\nRepetition|4959|4973."}
{"prompt":"Kerry On Edge As Legacy Crumbles\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry wasted no time condemning President Trump’s decision not to recertify, and to possibly withdraw from, the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran that Kerry negotiated on behalf of his boss Barack Obama.\nPresident Trump insisted on significant improvements to the Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action (JCPOA), as the deal is formally known.\nThe JCPOA’s fundamental flaws that President Trump wants fixed include Iran’s ability to block unfettered international inspections, the wiggle room that Iran is exploiting to continue developing and testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and the sunset clause on nuclear enrichment that would provide Iran a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state after the current restrictions are lifted.\nObama and Kerry had promised that these issues would be dealt with satisfactorily before agreeing to the final terms of the JCPOA.\nInstead they caved to Iranian pressure in order to get the deal done.\nNow that President Trump is trying to clean up the mess Obama and Kerry left him, Kerry has the gall to label President Trump’s decision a \"reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology\" and to accuse the Trump administration of “lying to the American people.” It was the Obama administration that recklessly abandoned the facts in pressing ahead with the deal.\nThe Obama administration lied to the American people, abandoning its own promises to ensure that the deal contained ironclad protections.\nMoreover, all that President Trump has done so far is to return the JCPOA to Congress for review.\nHad Obama followed the Constitution and submitted the JCPOA to the Senate as a treaty in the first place, the JCPOA in its present form almost certainly would not have been approved.\nCongress should now have the opportunity to revisit the JCPOA to determine whether the protections that the Obama administration promised are working as advertised.\nCongress should also consider whether time limits on Iran’s commitments continue to make sense in light of what we are now experiencing with Iran’s nuclear technology collaborator, North Korea.\nIt bought time to turn into a full-fledged nuclear power under our noses.\nKerry had promised that the Iranian regime would be prohibited from testing ballistic missiles.\nThis turned out to be a lie.\nAfter the JCPOA was finalized, with no such prohibition included, Iran continued to test such missiles.\nThe Obama administration’s response was that the missiles had become a separate issue, to be dealt with under a new United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the JCPOA.\nThe new resolution replaced clear prohibitions imposed on Iran’s ballistic missile program with a weak declaration in an annex that simply “calls upon” Iran not to undertake any activity such as development and test launches related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons for eight years.\nIran has tested several ballistic missiles during the last two years, including two Qadr H missiles with the phrase “Israel must be wiped out” emblazoned on the sides.\nThe commander of Iran’s Army, Major General Ataollah Salehi, had told reporters just a month before the launch of those missiles that Iran was \"neither paying any attention to the resolutions against Iran, nor implementing them.\nThis is not a breach of the JCPOA.”\nRussian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin, spurning requests from Obama administration officials to impose sanctions against Iran under the Security Council resolution, asserted that the Iranian missile test did not violate the resolution.\n“A call is different from a ban so legally you cannot violate a call, you can comply with a call or you can ignore the call, but you cannot violate a call,” the Russian ambassador said.\nIn short, the JCPOA did not cover the missile tests and the replacement UN Security Council resolution that did mention the missiles is toothless.\nDeputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told CNN, during an interview aired on April 6, 2015, that under the deal’s terms then still being negotiated, “you will have anywhere, anytime, 24\/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has.\"\nRhodes claimed that “if we see a site that we need to inspect on a military facility, we can get access to that site and inspect it.\nSo if it's a suspicious site that we believe is related to its nuclear efforts, we can get access and inspect that site through the IAEA.” This was another lie.\nAfter the JCPOA was finalized in July 2015, Rhodes shamelessly denied that anytime, anywhere inspections were ever considered as part of the negotiations.\n“We never sought in this negotiation the capacity for so-called anytime, anywhere,” Rhodes said on July 14, 2015.\nThe JCPOA’s supporters, including Kerry, have made much of the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has on several occasions verified Iran’s compliance with its commitments under the JCPOA, keeping its stock of low-enriched uranium below the limit set forth in the JCPOA and not pursuing further construction of the Arak reactor.\nIran was found to have slightly exceeded the limit on its stock of heavy water, but has remedied the problem to the IAEA’s satisfaction.\nIAEA chief Yukiya Amano reiterated in a statement he issued on October 9th that Iran has remained in compliance with its JCPOA commitments.\nThe problem, as any clear-eyed observer of the process recognizes, is that the IAEA relies on Iran for self-inspection of certain sites that the regime does not want the IAEA to inspect freely on its own.\nIAEA inspectors have avoided examining military sites it knows exists and has no reliable way of tracking undeclared sites.\nThe IAEA’s explanation for not visiting any of Iran’s known military sites is that it had “no reason to ask” for access.\nEvidently, the IAEA is supposed to block out the fact that Iran had conducted tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations at a military site before the JCPOA’s finalization in 2015.\nThe IAEA should just pretend that such tests could not possibly happen again.\n“Nobody is allowed to visit Iran's military sites,” said Iran’s Head of Strategic Research Center at the Expediency Council and adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, Ali Akbar Velayati.\nIntimidation works.\nThe IAEA knows not to ask.\nAs to the JCPOA’s sunset provisions, the Obama administration lied about that too.\nKerry claimed on September 2, 2015 that the JCPOA “never sunsets.\nThere’s no sunset in this agreement.”\nThis month Kerry has resorted to parsing words.\nHe claims the phrase 'sunset provisions' is a “misnomer,” before then defending the JCPOA’s time limits.\n\"We were comfortable because the cap on Iran’s low-enriched uranium stockpile remains in place until 2030,” Kerry wrote in an article published in the Washington Post late last month.\nIn other words, let’s just kick the can down the road and hope for a more reasonable Iranian regime in 13 years that would agree to extend the time limits.\nIn the meantime, Kerry advises us not to worry.\nKerry declared, “15 or 25 years from now, we still have the same military options we have today.”\nJohn Kerry has obviously learned nothing from the North Korean fiasco, which resulted from years of phony agreements with the rogue regime and so-called “strategic patience.” The United States clearly does not have the same military options today to deal with a nuclear armed North Korea as it did 23 years ago when former President Bill Clinton decided not to use military force to stamp out North Korea’s nuclear program at its inception.\nInstead, Clinton started us down the primrose path of naïve diplomacy with a duplicitous regime that now is on the verge of being able to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear warheads delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles.\nIt is precisely because North Korea’s actions over the last 23 years have proven that making concessions to a rogue regime in order to obtain denuclearization commitments is so dangerous that President Trump does not want to make the same mistake with Iran.\nAmerica’s European allies are also upset with President Trump for refusing to recertify the deal and threatening to pull out if certain conditions are not met.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint statement last Friday praising the JCPOA and its implementation.\nThey said that the nuclear deal with Iran was “the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran’s nuclear programme is not diverted for military purposes.\nTherefore, we encourage the US Administration and Congress to consider the implications to the security of the US and its allies before taking any steps that might undermine the JCPOA, such as re-imposing sanctions on Iran lifted under the agreement.”\nPerhaps these European leaders should remember their own history.\nAppeasement through phony deals with a rogue dictatorship does not work, as proven by the infamous Munich Pact signed by British and French Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Edouard Daladier with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler seventy-nine years ago.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"FBI Informant “Threatened” After Offering Details Linking Clinton Foundation To Russian Bribery Case\n\nThis report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge\nWhile the mainstream media has largely ignored it, the scandal surrounding Russian efforts to acquire 20% of America’s uranium reserves, a deal which was ultimately approved by the Obama administration, and more specifically the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) which included Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder, is becoming more problematic for Democrats by the hour.\nAs The Hill pointed out earlier this morning, the latest development in this sordid tale revolves around a man that the FBI used as an informant back in 2009 and beyond to build a case against a Russian perpetrator who ultimately admitted to bribery, extortion and money laundering.\nThe informant, who is so far only known as “Confidential Source 1,” says that when he attempted to come forward last year with information that linked the Clinton Foundation directly to the scandal he was promptly silenced by the FBI and the Obama administration.\nWorking as a confidential witness, the businessman made kickback payments to the Russians with the approval of his FBI handlers and gathered other evidence, the records show.\nSources told The Hill the informant’s work was crucial to the government’s ability to crack a multimillion dollar racketeering scheme by Russian nuclear officials on U.S. soil that involved bribery, kickbacks, money laundering and extortion.\nIn the end, the main Russian executive sent to the U.S. to expand Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nuclear business, an executive of an American trucking firm and a Russian financier from New Jersey pled guilty to various crimes in a case that started in 2009 and ended in late 2015.\nToensing added her client has had contact from multiple congressional committees seeking information about what he witnessed inside the Russian nuclear industry and has been unable to provide that information because of the NDA.\n“He can’t disclose anything that he came upon in the course of his work,” she said.\nThe information the client possesses includes specific allegations that Russian executives made to him about how they facilitated the Obama administration’s 2010 approval of the Uranium One deal and sent millions of dollars in Russian nuclear funds to the U.S. to an entity assisting Bill Clinton’s foundation.\nAt the time, Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of State on the government panel that approved the deal, the lawyer said.\nIt has been previously reported that Bill Clinton accepted $500,000 in Russian speaking fees in 2010 and collected millions more in donations for his foundation from parties with a stake in the Uranium One deal, transactions that both the Clintons and the Obama administration denied had any influence on the approval.\nIn the midst of the new discoveries revealed yesterday about the Uranium One case (see: FBI Uncovered Russian Bribery Plot Before Obama Approved Uranium One Deal, Netting Clintons Millions), “Confidential Source 1” has once again hired an attorney, Victoria Toensing, a former Reagan Justice Department official and former chief counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to get his story out.\nSitting down with The Hill earlier, Toensing said that the last time her client tried to speak out “both his reputation and liberty” were “threatened” by the Obama administration in a effort to force his silence.\n“All of the information about this corruption has not come out,” she said in an interview Tuesday.\n“And so my client, the same part of my client that made him go into the FBI in the first place, says, ‘This is wrong.\nWhat should I do about it?’”\nToensing said she also possesses memos that recount how the Justice Department last year threatened her client when he attempted to file a lawsuit that could have drawn attention to the Russian corruption during the 2016 presidential race as well as helped him recover some of the money Russians stole from him through kickbacks during the FBI probe.\nThe undercover client witnessed “a lot of bribery going on around the U.S.” but was asked by the FBI to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) that prevents him from revealing what he knows to Congress, Toensing explained.\nWhen he tried to bring some of the allegations to light in the lawsuit last year, “the Obama Justice Department threatened him with loss of freedom.\nThey said they would bring a criminal case against him for violating an NDA,” she added.\nEmails obtained by The Hill show that a civil attorney working with the former undercover witness described the pressure the Justice Department exerted to keep the client from disclosing to a federal court what he knew last summer.\n“The government was taking a very harsh position that threatened both your reputation and liberty,” the civil lawyer wrote in one email.\nIn another, she added, “As you will recall the gov’t made serious threats sufficient to cause you to withdraw your civil complaint.”\nAs we pointed out last summer when Peter Schweizer first released his feature documentary Clinton Cash, the Uranium One deal at the center of this scandal is believed to have netted the Clintons and their Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations and ‘speaking fees’ from Uranium One shareholders and other Russian entities.\nRussian Purchase of US Uranium Assets in Return for $145mm in Contributions to the Clinton Foundation – Bill and Hillary Clinton assisted a Canadian financier, Frank Giustra, and his company, Uranium One, in the acquisition of uranium mining concessions in Kazakhstan and the United States.\nSubsequently, the Russian government sought to purchase Uranium One but required approval from the Obama administration given the strategic importance of the uranium assets.\nIn the run-up to the approval of the deal by the State Department, nine shareholders of Uranium One just happened to make $145mm in donations to the Clinton Foundation.\nMoreover, the New Yorker confirmed that Bill Clinton received $500,000 in speaking fees from a Russian investment bank, with ties to the Kremlin, around the same time.\nNeedless to say, the State Department approved the deal giving Russia ownership of 20% of U.S. uranium assets.\nMeanwhile, the ‘journalists’ over at CNN are still trying to get to the bottom of exactly who spent the $100,000 on Facebook ads…\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?\n\nTraditionalists are often derided by neo-Catholic commentators for relying on supposedly apocryphal quotations from Popes or saints bearing on the current ecclesial crisis.\nBut these critics never demonstrate that the oft-cited quotations are apocryphal; they merely assert that they must be, as they seem too probative to be true.\nThis is often done in comment boxes or responses to online queries at neo-Catholic websites, wherein the neo-Catholic commentator professes he can find no source for a given quotation—meaning he hasn’t bothered to do any serious investigation beyond a few Google searches.\nTake this quotation of Pius XII, for example, speaking in 1931 when he was still Monsignor Pacelli, serving as Pius XI’s Secretary of State:\nI am worried by the Blessed Virgin’s messages to Lucy of Fatima.\nThis persistence of Mary about the dangers which menace the Church is a divine warning against the suicide that would be represented by the alteration of the faith, in her liturgy, her theology and her soul….\n\nI hear all around me innovators who wish to dismantle the Sacred Chapel, destroy the universal flame of the Church, reject her ornaments and make her feel remorse for her historical past.\n\nA day will come when the civilized world will deny its God, when the Church will doubt as Peter doubted.\nShe will be tempted to believe that man has become God.\nIn our churches, Christians will search in vain for the red lamp where God awaits them.\nLike Mary Magdalene, weeping before the empty tomb, they will ask, “Where have they taken Him?”\nWhen I first cited this quotation some 17 years ago, I was contacted by a very prominent neo-Catholic luminary who demanded a source for it, because he and his friends believed it was “apocryphal.” I did not receive the courtesy of a thank-you when I pointed him to pp.\n52-53 of Msgr.\nRoche’s biography of Pius XII, Pie XII Devant L’Histoire (Paris: Editions Robert Laffont, 1972), an out-of-print French-language work I managed to obtain after an extensive search of used book seller inventory.\nThe French original text confirms the accuracy of the English translation I had seen before I cited the statement.\n\nA Modernist apostate priest, one Emile Poulet, who left the priesthood and married, attempted to cast doubt on the credibility of Msgr.\nRoche’s account of the words of the future Pius XII.\nSmall wonder: Poulet, who died in 2014 at the age of 94, belonged to the “worker-priest” movement that none other than Pius XII had condemned, as I note here.\nHis attempt to debunk the quotation involved nit-picking about what he claimed were factual errors elsewhere in the Roche biography.\nBut he had no evidence that the quotation as such was a fabrication.\nHe simply wished that it was so.\n\nLet’s give our neo-Catholic friends another “apocryphal” quotation to dismiss out of hand.\nThis one pertains to an astonishing prophecy by Saint Francis of Assisi about a future occupant of the Chair of Peter:\n\nA short time before the holy Father’s [St. Francis’] death, he called together his children and warned them of the coming troubles:\n\n“Act bravely, my brethren; take courage and trust in the Lord.\nThe time is fast approaching in which there will be great trials and afflictions; perplexities and dissensions, both spiritual and temporal, will abound; the charity of many will grow cold, and the malice of the wicked will increase.\nThe devils will have unusual power; the immaculate purity of our Order, and of others, will be so much obscured that there will be very few Christians who obey the true Supreme Pontiff and the Roman Church with loyal ears and perfect charity.\n\n“At the time of this tribulation a man, not canonically elected, will be raised to the Pontificate, who, by his cunning, will endeavour to draw many into error and death.\nThen scandals will be multiplied, our Order will be divided, and many others will be entirely destroyed, because they will consent to error instead of opposing it.\n\n“There will be such diversity of opinions and schisms among the people, the religious and the clergy, that, except those days were shortened, according to the words of the Gospel, even the elect would be led into error, were they not specially guided, amid such great confusion, by the immense mercy of God….\n\n“Those who persevere in their fervor and adhere to virtue with love and zeal for the truth, will suffer injuries and persecutions as rebels and schismatics; for their persecutors, urged on by the evil spirits, will say they are rendering a great service to God by destroying such pestilent men from the face of the earth…\n\n“Some preachers will keep silent about the truth, and others will trample it under foot and deny it.\nSanctity of life will be held in derision even by those who outwardly profess it, for in those days Our Lord Jesus Christ will send them, not a true Pastor, but a destroyer.” [paragraph breaks added]\n\nThis quotation appears in Works of the Seraphic Father, St. Francis of Assisi, published in 1882 by the London-based Catholic publishing house R. Washbourne, 1882, pp.\n248-250).\nIt is readily available as a Google book.\nThe same book, it must be noted, contains an appendix setting forth “Doubtful Works of Saint Francis,” of which the quotation is not part.\nThus, the publisher itself carefully distinguished the authentic prophecies of Saint Francis from what might be apocryphal.\nMoreover, in 1882 there could hardly have been any “radical traditionalist” motive to circulate phony quotations of the saint.\n\"St. Francis in Ecstacy\", Caravaggio, 1595\nSaint Francis’ prophecy is clearly not a prediction of the Great Western Schism (1378-1417), which did not involve a “destroyer” on the Chair of Peter who leads the faithful into error, widespread apostasy, and the persecution of faithful Catholics as “schismatics.” But it does contain elements very familiar to us today.\nAnd what inference might one draw from the coincidence that Saint Francis’ prophecy of a future “destroyer” in the papal office seems to correspond rather well with the pontificate of the only Pope who has taken Francis’ name as his own?\n\nSomething else to consider: Saint Francis, one of the greatest saints in Church history, one of the few who is known and revered by the whole world, freely revealed his vision of an ecclesial destroyer who usurps the papal office.\nThat is, Saint Francis did not suffer from the currently reigning papolatry, which holds that the indefectibility of the Church depends upon defending every word and deed of a given Pope as somehow consistent with Tradition and declares absolutely inadmissible the idea that the holder of the Petrine office could be a threat to the integrity of the Faith.\nRather, Saint Francis, illuminated by heaven itself, recognized the coming reality of what Saint Robert Bellarmine, a Doctor of the Church, hypothesized as possible in principle, to cite another “apocryphal” quotation:\nJust as it is licit to resist the Pontiff that aggresses the body, it is also licit to resist the one who aggresses souls or who disturbs civil order, or, above all, who attempts to destroy the Church.\nI say that it is licit to resist by not doing what he orders and by preventing his will from being executed…\nDe Controversiis on the Roman Pontiff, trans.\nRyan Grant (Mediatrix Press: 2015), Book II, Chapter 29, p. 303.\n\nDid Saint Francis predict the coming of Pope Francis?\nThat is not for us to judge, although the Church may­ well issue a judgment of Francis like that of the posthumous anathema of Honorius­­ I.\nWould Saint Francis have been horrified by the words and deeds of the Pope who has presumed to take his name?\nThat question answers itself.\n>","completion":" Doubt|557|644\nName_Calling,Labeling|2803|2827\nDoubt|5924|6161\nLoaded_Language|1083|1248\nLoaded_Language|1429|1550\nDoubt|2617|2789\nLoaded_Language|2904|2927\nLoaded_Language|2792|2881\nLoaded_Language|3393|3674\nLoaded_Language|4323|4478\nLoaded_Language|5527|5556\nThought-terminating_Cliches|7698|7726\nAppeal_to_Authority|3137|3197."}

{"prompt":"FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist\n\nDepartment of Justice Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz has released his 500 plus-page report, which purports to shine a light on the mishandling at top levels of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation of the 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State under former President Obama.\nSuch mishandling included violations of Department of Justice standards and FBI protocols.\nThe report from the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) criticized certain actions and decisions of former FBI Director James Comey, together with those of other senior FBI officials who were involved in the probe, including former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe.\nMr. McCabe is already the subject of an earlier criminal referral from the OIG for his alleged unauthorized leaks to the media and lying to federal investigators about his media contacts.\nSpecial FBI agent Peter Stzrok and Lisa Page, an attorney who has since left the FBI, were targeted in this report for their blatantly anti-Trump text messages.\nFormer Attorney General Loretta Lynch was also criticized for exercising bad judgment in connection with her infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton.\nMr. Horowitz’s report focused on process and procedures.\nThe inspector general made clear when he launched his investigation in January 2017 that “his review will not substitute the OIG's judgment for the judgments made by the FBI or the Department regarding the substantive merits of investigative or prosecutive decisions.\"\nMoreover, this report did not address whether the Department of Justice or FBI abused the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to obtain a surveillance order against former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page, or the government’s reliance on former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele’s salacious and unverified “dossier” in its FISA court application, which the OIG is investigating separately.\nIn analyzing the highly anticipated OIG report’s conclusions, it is clear that either Mr. Horowitz himself decided to pull his punches or that the final version, which had been reviewed by upper echelons in both the FBI and Justice Department before its public release, emerged in a disappointingly watered-down form.\nTo be sure, the report faulted Comey for deviating from FBI and Justice Department procedures in handling the probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State, thereby negatively impacting “the perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice.” Comey, according to the OIG report, “engaged in ad hoc decision making based on his personal views even if it meant rejecting longstanding Department policy or practice.”\nStarting with Comey’s public announcement on July 5, 2016 criticizing Hillary Clinton and her staff for being “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,” but also announcing that the FBI was “expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,” Comey was taken to task for insubordination and usurping the authority of the attorney general.\nHe “upset the well-established separation between investigative and prosecutorial functions,” the report said.\nComey’s follow-up letters to Congress on October 28 and November 6, 2016 were similarly criticized.\nThe first letter informed Congress that agents were reopening their probe into Clinton’s handling of classified material after discovering her e-mails on the laptop of Andrew Weiner, the husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.\nThis letter was followed on November 6, 2016 by Comey’s statement that the review of the additional information had been completed and that the FBI remained convinced that charges were not appropriate.\nComey acted against the advice of senior Justice Department officials in making these disclosures the way he did.\nThe OIG report was highly critical of the FBI’s failure to take immediate action on the Weiner laptop when they first learned about it in late September 2016, rather than waiting another month so close to the election.\nThe criticisms of Comey's undisciplined behavior was all well and good, but it was reasonable to expect something more than the equivalent of a departmental employee review after nearly a year and a half of investigation.\nHillary Clinton’s supporters will no doubt jump on the inspector general’s criticisms of Comey’s handling of the July 5th announcement and subsequent letters as proof that he improperly influenced the outcome of the election in President Trump’s favor, even if he did not do so deliberately for political reasons.\nHowever, what Comey really did was to give Hillary Clinton a Get Out of Jail Free card.\nThe fix was in as early as May 2016, well before the FBI interviews of Hillary Clinton and of as many as 17 other key witnesses, when Comey began the process of drafting an exoneration memo.\nComey’s initial draft statement, which he shared with FBI senior leadership on May 2, criticized Clinton’s handling of classified information as “grossly negligent,” but concluded that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring a case based on the facts developed in the investigation.\nIndeed, Comey admitted in his book that “we started the Clinton investigation aware that it was unlikely to be a case that career prosecutors at the Department of Justice would prosecute.”\nIf putting the cart of exoneration before the horse of investigation were not enough, Comey’s draft statement underwent various language changes over the course of the next two months, including, most importantly, changing the description of Clinton’s handling of classified information from “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless.” This change was critical because “gross negligence” is specifically the legal term used in stating the statutory requirement in 18 U.S. Code § 793(f) for a finding of criminal conduct.\nComey’s substitution of a legally meaningless phrase, “extremely careless,” for the “gross negligence” statutory legal standard he had originally used, had the effect of prejudging the facts in Hillary Clinton’s favor.\nAndrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were involved in the edits.\nInspector General Horowitz saw no problem with this pattern of obfuscation regarding the deletion of the legally significant phrase “gross negligence” from Comey’s statement.\nMr. Horowitz relied in part on opinions from prosecutors that there was not enough evidence to charge Clinton with acting in a manner that rose to a level of criminal gross negligence with respect to sending or receiving e-mails determined to contain classified information.\nMr. Horowitz’s report thus concluded, “We did not identify evidence of bias or improper considerations.” This conclusion defies common sense.\nGross negligence is not the same as willful intent, which Comey and his team sought to conflate in exonerating Hillary Clinton before the investigation was concluded.\nClinton was fully aware of what she was doing when she set up the private server arrangement in the first place and knowingly used it to send and receive e-mails involving official government business, which by their very nature would be expected to include classified information.\nIt turns out that some of the e-mails were accessed by foreign parties.\nHillary lied repeatedly when she first denied there were any classified e-mails on her system and then described some of the e-mails involved in the investigation as having been classified after the fact.\nAs Comey has admitted, several e-mail chains concerned matters that were classified at the Top Secret\/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received by Clinton.\nCoupled with her agents’ destruction of thousands of e-mails that had been subpoenaed by Congress, Hillary’s conduct was criminally reckless at the very least, if not constituting willful intent to commit an act she knew was wrongful.\nYet Mr. Horowitz saw no reason to doubt the sincerity of Comey's explanations for giving Hillary a free pass.\nThe failure to at least empanel a grand jury to compel testimony from Hillary Clinton and key witnesses was itself a complete dereliction of duty, which could have only been motivated by a desire to treat Hillary Clinton with kid gloves for improper reasons.\nIncredibly, however, Mr. Horowitz’s report “found no persuasive evidence… that the outcome of the investigation would have been different had Clinton been subpoenaed before the grand jury.”\nMr. Horowitz also did not deem Comey’s possible perjury in his testimony before Congress to be an appropriate subject for criminal referral.\nComey testified that his decision to exonerate Hillary was not made before her interview took place, when for all intents and purposes it was.\nMr. Horowitz simply took Comey’s word for what he had meant.\nInspector General Horowitz again emphasized form and process over substance in finding a “troubling lack of any direct, substantive communication” between Comey and Attorney General Lynch ahead of Comey’s July 5 press conference on Clinton and his October 28 letter to Congress.\nAttorney General Lynch’s infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton was discussed in the report, but mostly in the context of how it affected Comey’s decision to go rogue, so to speak, in making his July 5th announcement without prior approval from the Justice Department.\nAs to the substance of Ms. Lynch’s decision to meet with Bill Clinton at all before his wife’s FBI interview, all Mr. Horowitz’s report had to say was that it was “an error in judgment.”\nThe OIG report also criticized the conduct of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who had exchanged text messages sharply critical of Mr. Trump before and after the election, for casting “a cloud over the entire FBI investigation.” The report referenced a text message on August 8, 2016, in which Strzok reassured Page that she need not worry about Donald Trump becoming president.\nTrump is “not ever going to become president, right?\nRight?\n!” Page texted Strzok.\n“No.\nNo he’s not.\nWe’ll stop it,” Strzok responded.\nMr. Horowitz wrote that this exchange was “not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate’s electoral prospects.” The inspector general questioned whether Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia collusion investigation over following up on the Clinton e-mail-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias.\nUltimately, however, he inexplicably concluded that there was no finding of “documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions” discussed in the OIG report.\nStrzok should have been subject to a criminal referral for arguably violating 18 U.S.C.\n§ 595, enacted as part of the original 1939 Hatch Act, prohibiting any public officer or employee, in connection with an activity financed wholly or in part by the United States, from using his or her official authority to interfere with or affect the nomination or election of a candidate for federal office including the president of the United States.\nThe punishment for violation is a fine, imprisonment for not more than one year or both.\nInstead, Strzok's punishment will most likely be limited to disciplinary action and possibly dismissal.\nIn sum, the long-awaited inspector general report on the FBI’s and Justice Department’s handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation is as disappointing as the rigged outcome of the e-mail investigation itself.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Black Death: ‘It’s 100 % Likely’ It Spreads To The UK And A ‘Ticking Time Bomb’ Ready To Decimate The World\n\nThe death toll in Madagascar due to the plague has jumped for the first time since health officials claimed the infection was in the beginning stages of control.\nWith the new uptick in those who died, the fear that the disease will spread to the United Kingdom has been confirmed as “100 percent likely.”\nThe plague death toll has now shown signs that it’s picking up speed again.\nOfficial figures reveal 165 people have now lost their lives in Madagascar’s “worst outbreak in 50 years.” Recent data shows a 15 percent jump in fatalities over just three days, coupled with scientists concerned that the black death has reached a “crisis” point.\nTen other African countries have also been placed on high alert, warning that an outbreak could occur at any time.\nAt least 2,034 people have been infected down by a more lethal form of the black death so far in the country, which lies off the coast of Africa, according to WHO statistics.\nSome experts fear the disease (which is so deadly because it is airborne) could mutate and become untreatable during this year’s outbreak – which is expected to blight Madagascar until April.\nOthers worry the plague will go beyond mainland Africa and eventually reach the US, Europe, and Britain.\nThe plague spreads easily and can kill within 48 hours.\nThat would leave millions more vulnerable to the outbreak, and create a short supply of life-saving antibiotics.\nAccording to the Daily Mail, experts warn the outbreak of plague in Madagascar this year is being fueled by a strain more lethal than the one which usually strikes the country.\nThis form of the pneumonic plague is airborne, easily spread by a cough or a sneeze, and has been responsible for two-thirds of all infections this year.\nThe bubonic form of the plague, responsible for the “Black Death” in the 14th century strikes the country each year and infects around 600 people.\nBut with over 2000 alread infected by pneumonic plague (and counting) health officials aren’t willing to quit sounding alarms just yet.\nPaul Hunter, a professor of health protection at the world-renowned University of East Anglia, was the first expert to predict the plague could travel across the sea.\nHe previously said: “The big anxiety is it could spread to mainland Africa, it’s not probable, but certainly possible, that might then be difficult to control.\nIf we don’t carry on doing stuff here, at one point something will happen and it will get out of our control and cause huge devastation all around the world.” There is always a risk with travel that the disease will spread globally, Hunter added.\n“We don’t want a situation where the disease spreads so fast it gets out of control.\nWe are talking about it spreading in days rather than weeks.” But Hunter is adamant that a well-developed country could manage the plague should a global outbreak occur.\nHopefully, most will never have to find out how well another country can manage this infection.\nA few health experts have warned that there is no threat to the UK, however, some have warned the plague outbreak will certainly spread to the region.\nRichard Conroy, the founder of Sick Holiday, has sent a chilling warning to UK authorities.\nConway is saying it’s “only a matter of time” before the disease arrives on British soil.\nConroy warned it is inevitable that the plague will spread due to the vast movement of people across the globe.\n“I believe that it’s 100 percent likely that plague will arrive in the UK once more – it’s just a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’.\nAnd it’s not an exaggeration to say that this is a real threat – a ticking time bomb that’s waiting to decimate the world,” Conroy continued.\n“With the current outbreak still remaining treatable with antibiotics, however, the current risk is low.”\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|58|107\nAppeal_to_Authority|567|596\nLoaded_Language|807|817\nAppeal_to_Authority|1118|1153\nName_Calling,Labeling|1893|1906\nAppeal_to_Authority|3126|3198\nLoaded_Language|3256|3272\nAppeal_to_Authority|3494|3577\nRepetition|3302|3380\nRepetition|3389|3440\nRepetition|3494|3620\nName_Calling,Labeling|0|11\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|819|867\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1049|1061\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1249|1274\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|1408|1481\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|2451|2607\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|2654|2682\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|3580|3620\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|3687|3743."}

{"prompt":"Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama\n\nPresident Trump’s summit Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki created a firestorm of controversy.\nPresident Trump seemed to be publicly siding with the Russian dictator against the American intelligence agencies.\nThe initial appearance was so bad that I tweeted: “President Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin.\nIt is the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected – immediately.”\nAfter flying home from Helsinki and reviewing the tape and transcript of his press conference with Putin, President Trump said he has “full faith and support for America’s great intelligence agencies” and that he accepts “our intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election took place.”\nIn his remarks to members of Congress Tuesday that were televised by the media, President Trump went on to admit that he realized he needed to clarify his statements in Helsinki.\nThe president said: “It should have been obvious – I thought it would be obvious – but I would like to clarify, just in case it wasn’t.\nIn a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word ‘would’ instead of “wouldn’t.” The sentence should have been: I don’t see any reason why I wouldn’t – or why it wouldn’t be Russia.\nSo just to repeat it, I said the word ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn’t’ …\n“I have, on numerous occasions, noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections.\nUnlike previous administrations, my administration has and will continue to move aggressively to repeal any efforts – and repel – we will stop it, we will repel it – any efforts to interfere in our elections.\nWe’re doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018.”\nAnyone who has studied President Trump knows he hates to admit a mistake.\nHis natural pattern is to move forward and ignore mistakes.\nFor him, this was a big correction (and as I noted the day before, it was an absolutely necessary one).\nPresident Trump then reminded everyone of the Obama administration’s failures in dealing with Russian meddling in the election.\nPresident Trump noted that President Obama and his advisers had information that the Russians had been working to interfere in the election and they ignored it, because they thought Hillary Clinton was going to win.\nPresident Trump said: “President Obama, along with (then-CIA Director John) Brennan and (then Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper and the whole group that you see on television now – probably getting paid a lot of money by your networks – they knew about Russia’s attempt to interfere in the election in September, and they totally buried it.\nAnd as I said, they buried it because they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win.\nIt turned out it didn’t happen that way.\n“By contrast, my administration has taken a very firm stance – it’s a very firm stance – on a strong action.\nWe’re going to take strong action to secure our election systems and the process.”\nThere are two key facts in this statement.\nFirst, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016.\nThe very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America.\nIt was their duty in 2016 – not candidate Trump’s.\nSecond, the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being.\nThe Trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior.\nThe Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia.\nAlso, President Trump’s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy.\nFurthermore, President Trump’s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin.\nThe stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has.\nBeyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia:\nWhere President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression.\nWhen the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain, President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States.\nWhen the Russians retaliated, the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle.\nPresident Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York.\nMore than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons.\nDespite the hysteria of the left, it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia.\nNothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime.\nFinally, a brief word about the strong language and vicious comments about the president.\nWe are in the early stages of a cultural civil war in which the left sees itself losing.\nThis is what led me to write my new New York Times best-selling book, “Trump’s America: The Truth About Our Nation’s Great Comeback.” With each passing month the radical-extremist wing of the Democratic Party dominates the progressive wing more and more.\nWith President Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, it was clear that anyone Trump nominated was going to be attacked.\nIn fact, the demonstrators protesting the nomination had signs for all four of the finalists and were instantly ready to oppose the president regardless of his choice.\nSimilarly, Obama-era national security officials seem determined to use the harshest possible language to attack President Trump.\nI think their strong words and hysteria are driven by their own guilt.\nWhatever the Russians did, they did while Brennan was director of the CIA, Clapper was director of national intelligence, and James Comey was head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nThese former officials attack Trump ferociously to hide their own failure and their own guilt.\nJust keep that in mind the next time you see one of them on TV.\nMy prediction is that President Trump will remain tough on Russia, and the Helsinki press conference will be seen as the aberration it was.\n>","completion":"

Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who was indicted on federal officials this week on charges of misusing campaign finance funds for personal use.\nTrump did not directly answer a Fox News interviewer’s question about whether he intends to fire Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing the special counsel investigation, after November’s congressional elections.\nHe also said he only gave the former senator the job because Sessions was a supporter during the 2016 presidential race.\n— John T.

{"prompt":"Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’\n\nNewsCatholic Church\nBRATISLAVA, Slovakia, February 13, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Former Vatican doctrine chief Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller has decried the Church's current adaptation to the modern world and rejected the idea of blessing homosexual couples.\nThe remarks, made in a February 6 talk in Slovakia, indirectly respond to new initiatives coming from Germany, especially from Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode.\nCardinal Müller, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, spoke at a conference on John Paul II's encyclical Veritatis Splendor at the Comenius University in Bratislava, organized by the Slovakian Bishops' Conference.\nIn remarks after his address, reported by the German Catholic newspaper Die Tagespost, the cardinal made it clear what he thinks about the recently presented German idea of blessing homosexual unions, even if only in individual cases: “If a priest blesses a homosexual couple, then this is an atrocity at a holy site, namely, to approve of something that God does not approve of.”\nAccording to the Tagespost report, Cardinal Müller said in his address that he regrets the separation of the Church's doctrinal and moral teaching and called Christianity a “theocentric humanism.” He said the “submissive change of the Church into a NGO for the embetterment of the this-worldly life conditions” is a “suicidal modernization” that denies mankind the Truth of God.\nIn this context, the German cardinal also criticized Martin Luther's own denial of man's free will and his teaching about the total depravity of man that separates morality from the relationship with God.\nMorality, Müller explained, is rooted in Grace; that is why any teaching about “rules and exceptions” ignores the character of the ethics of the Covenant and of Grace.\nIn the discussion following his talk, Cardinal Müller also responded to questions concerning Pope Francis' post-synodal exhortation, Amoris Laetitia.\nThe cardinal said that he is “not happy” about the fact that there are different interpretations of this papal text by some bishops' conferences.\n“In dogmatic questions, there cannot be a plurality,” he added.\nThere is only one Magisterium, he said, and bishops' conferences can only decide about pastoral questions.\nContradictory conceptions concerning the Sacraments, said the cardinal, lead into chaotic conditions.\nThus, explained the cardinal, the Sacraments have to be celebrated the way Christ Himself willed it when he instituted them.\nThe controversial eighth chapter of Amoris Laetitia has to be understood “in an orthodox way,” namely that “he who lives in the state of mortal sin cannot receive Holy Communion.” It is, in Müller's eyes, the pope's duty “to unite the Church, that is what the pope is there for.” This is what he, Müller, himself told the pope: when the bishops' conferences present different interpretations of Amoris Laetitia, the Church enters “into a situation like the one before the Reformation.”\nArchbishop Stanislav Zvolensy, President of the Slovakian Bishops' Conference and archbishop of Bratislava, told Die Tagespost that Veritatis Splendor is not only still valid, but shows timeless truths.\nPromulgated 25 years ago, the encyclical rejects authoritatively the theory of situation ethics, a theory that seems to be getting again much attention in our time, for example by theologians such as Professor Maurizio Chiodi.\nProfessor Livio Melina, the former President of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and the Family, was another speaker at the February 6 conference.\nHe stressed that Amoris Laetitia has to be “read in the context of the magisterial instructions of the encyclical Veritatis Splendor, which recalls the connection between conscience and truth, as well as the necessity of a well-formed conscience.” In returning to that encyclical, explained the Italian professor and theologian, Amoris Laetitia could be given a hermeneutic in light of a “continuity with the Magisterium of the Church.” He also said: “The Commandments are an expression of the Love of God for us.\nIf we fulfill them, we are united with God.”\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_Authority|834|846\nLoaded_Language|45|67\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|983|1127\nLoaded_Language|1029|1063\nLoaded_Language|1338|1505\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|2177|2229\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|2240|2345\nAppeal_to_Authority|2479|2572\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|2682|2753\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|4118|4224\nName_Calling,Labeling|1302|1322\nName_Calling,Labeling|1445|1467."}

examining a new plan to help Iranians fighting the hardline regime in Iran following America's exit from the landmark nuclear deal and reimposition of harsh economic sanctions that could topple a regime already beset by protests and a crashing economy, according to a copy of the plan obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.\nThe three-page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials in the White House offers a strategy by which the Trump administration can actively work to assist an already aggravated Iranian public topple the hardline ruling regime through a democratization strategy that focuses on driving a deeper wedge between the Iranian people and the ruling regime.\nThe plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009.\nThe regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton—a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change—entered the White House.\nAh, yes, John Bolton.\nWhile I applaud Bolton for his willingness to call Islamic jihadis just that, I am not so naive as to consider that his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations has no effect in this decision.\n\"The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation, while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command,\" SSG writes in the paper.\n\"This has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months.\"\nWell, why is that?\nIt's due to sanctions imposed by the likes of the US.\nAs has been pointed out before, sanctions hurt the people, not the governments that lead them and then those same governments use the effects to propagandize the people against those who are ordering the sanctions.\nI'm not saying the Iranian government is good, but it is Iran's government.\nHonestly, I see a ton of corruption and warmongering in our own government that rivals some of that of governments that America stands against.\nStill, as was pointed out by Matt Agorist, Bolton told an audience of the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran:\n“There is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today.\nI had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs’ regime in Tehran.\nThe behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself.\nAnd that’s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!”\nAnd again, this really has nothing to do with the US.\nOne source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, solidified the Iranian regime’s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change.\n“The JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the Islamic Republic,” said the source, who would only speak to the Free Beacon on background about the sensitive issue.\n“Prior to that, everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism.\nIt’s now Trump, Bolton, and [Mike] Pompeo’s job to put this consensus back in place.”\nThe source told the Beacon that Bolton is “acutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region.”\n“John is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally, and knows that you’re never going to fundamentally change its behavior—and the threats against Israel and the Saudis especially—until that revolutionary regime is gone,” the source said, adding that “nothing’s off the table right now if Israel is attacked.”\nOK, I get they may pose a danger, but let's look at the reality here.\nThose they pose a danger to, namely Saudi Arabia and Israel can both fend perfectly well for themselves and have demonstrated that ability to do it.\nThere is no need for the US to be involved in it in any way.\nWhy should we be fighting a battle or encouraging, funding, and I'm quite sure arming, a rebellion?\nWhere is that authorized in our Constitution?\nSimple.\nIt isn't.\nI care little for the Saudi government as they help push Sharia and is the land where many of the 9-11 hijackers came from.\nThe Iranian government I care for even less, but out of each of those, which one should America have dealt with militarily following 9-11?\nBoth, if you're going to go by information that we have a record on.\nWhy can't America focus on it's own issues and solve those?\nIt's because we are too busy trying to police the world, keeping the spotlight off of those in our government who are attacking our rights and spending us into more and more debt.\nAnd lest you think this is about the nuclear deal.\nIt isn't.\n“The problem is not the Iran nuclear deal it’s the Iranian regime,” the source told the Beacon.\n“Team Bolton has spent years creating Plans B, C, and D for dealing with that problem.\nPresident Trump hired him knowing all of that.\nThe administration will now start aggressively moving to deal with the root cause of chaos and violence in the region in a clear-eyed way.”\nBolton says it will be accomplished in the next six months.\nI don't doubt it.\nThis will probably end up being another Ukraine situation, something we just don't need to be in, and yes, I know, I'll be called a liberal but honest readers who have followed me for some time know that's not the case.\nNotice some things that are taking place in Iran that the plan speaks about.\n“More than one third of Iran’s population is minority groups, many of whom already seek independence,” the paper explains.\n“U.S.\nsupport for these independence movements, both overt and covert, could force the regime to focus attention on them and limit its ability to conduct other malign activities.”\n“The probability the current Iranian theocracy will stop its nuclear program willingly or even under significant pressure is low,” the plan states.\n“Absent a change in government within Iran, America will face a choice between accepting a nuclear-armed Iran or acting to destroy as much of this capability as possible.”\nPresident Trump did made clear earlier in the week that we must make efforts to differentiate between the people of Iran and its ruling regime.\nWell, I agree, but that gets real messy when you start intervening in this manner.\n“Any public discussion of these options, and any messaging about the Iranian regime in general, should make a bright line distinction between the theocratic regime along with its organs of oppression and the general populace,” according to the plan.\n“We must constantly reinforce our support for removing the iron sandal from the necks of the people to allow them the freedom they deserve.”\nBut the Trump administration has spoken out on other countries where the people want their independence.\nRemember the Kurds?\nHow about the people in the Catalan region of Spain?\nNo support for those people, and why?\nCause it's not part of the agenda.\nI say if the Iranian people want their freedom, let them first free themselves from the bondage of Islam, and then let the passion that burns inside men to be

{"prompt":"Ex-Muslim Catholics to Pope Francis: “Naiveté in the face of Islam is suicidal and very dangerous”\n\n“Many ex-Muslims, such as Magdi Allam, are even leaving the Church, disgusted by her cowardice, wounded by equivocal gestures, confused by the lack of evangelization, scandalized by the praise given to Islam.”\nYes, and not just ex-Muslims.\nIt has become a superdogma in the Catholic Church: if you don’t believe that Islam is a Religion of Peace, you will be ruthlessly harassed and silenced by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the hierarchy elsewhere as well.\nThe bishops of the Catholic Church are much more concerned that you believe that Islam is a religion of peace than that you believe in, say, the Nicene Creed.\nAnd the Pope is almost certain to ignore this heartfelt appeal, as he has ignored others who have respectfully questioned his departures from Catholic teaching.\nI have yet to meet a Catholic prelate who believes that the requirement to treat all charitably applies to those who hold opinions that have been deemed unacceptable.\n“Leave them; they are blind guides.\nAnd if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.” (Matthew 15:14)\n“Islamic Converts Ask Pope in Open Letter To Change His Teaching on Islam,” by Steve Skojec, OnePeterFive.com, January 11, 2018:\nA new, open letter to the pope is making the rounds on the Internet, and it has gathered over 2,600 signatures so far.\n“Most Holy Father,” it begins, “‬Many of us ‬have tried to contact you, ‬on many occasions ‬and for several years, ‬and we have never received the slightest acknowledgement of our letters or requests for meetings.”\nThe letter is not from the dubia cardinals, or from the more than 800,000 signers of the 2015 Filial Appeal, or from the signatories of the Filial Correction, but from a group of Islamic converts to Catholicism, who want Francis to answer a simple question: why did they literally risk their lives to become Catholic if Islam is “a good religion in itself” as the pope “seems to teach”?\nIt’s a question he refuses to answer, despite endless platitudes of how important it is to be close to the marginalized and to accompany those on the peripheries of the Church.\nThe signers, however, are not dissuaded in their pursuit of a paternal answer:\nYou do not like to beat around the bush, and neither do we, so allow us to say frankly that we do not understand your teaching about Islam, as we read in paragraphs 252 and 253 of Evangelii Gaudium, because it does not account for the fact that Islam came AFTER Christ, and so is, and can only be, an Antichrist (see 1 Jn 2.22), and one of the most dangerous because it presents itself as the fulfillment of Revelation (of which Jesus would have been only a prophet).\nIf Islam is a good religion in itself, as you seem to teach, why did we become Catholic?\nDo not your words question the soundness of the choice we made at the risk of our lives?\nIslam prescribes death for apostates (Quran 4.89, 8.7-11), do you know?\nHow is it possible to compare Islamic violence with so-called Christian violence?\n“What is the relationship between Christ and Satan?\nWhat union is there between light and darkness?\nWhat association between the faithful and the unfaithful?” (2 Cor 6: 14-17)In accordance with His teaching (Lk 14:26), we preferred Him, the Christ, to our own life.\nAre we not in a good position to talk to you about Islam?\nThe letter makes short work of the notion that Islam and Christianity can ever be compatible, or that Islam can serve as a path to salvation:\nIn fact, as long as Islam wants us to be its enemy, we are, and all our protestations of friendship cannot change anything.\nAs a proper Antichrist, Islam exists only as an enemy of all: “Between us and you there is enmity and hatred forever, until you believe in Allah alone!” (Qur’an 60.4) For the Qur’an, Christians “are only impurity” (Quran 9.28),” “the worst of Creation” (Qur’an 98.6), all condemned to Hell (Qur’an 4.48), so Allah must exterminate them (Quran 9.30).\nWe must not be deceived by the Quranic verses deemed tolerant, because they have all been repealed by the verse of the Sword (Quran 9.5).\nWhere the Gospel proclaims the good news of Jesus’ death and resurrection for the salvation of all, and the fulfillment of the Covenant initiated with the Hebrews, Allah has nothing to offer but war and murder of the “infidels” in exchange for his paradise: “They fight on the way of Allah, they kill and are killed.” (Quran 9:11) We do not confuse Islam with Muslims, but if for you “dialogue” means the voice of peace, for Islam it’s only another way to make war.\nAlso, as it was in the face of Nazism and communism, naiveté in the face of Islam is suicidal and very dangerous.\nHow can you speak of peace and endorse Islam, as you seem to do: “To wring from our hearts the disease that plagues our lives (…) Let those who are Christians do it with the Bible and those who are Muslims do it with the Quran.\n“(Rome, January 20, 2014)?\nThat the Pope seems to propose the Quran as a way of salvation, is that not cause for worry?\nShould we return to Islam?\nThe authors say that Islam can be no ally in the battle “against the powers that want to dominate and enslave the world” because “they share the same totalitarian logic based on the rejection of the kingship of Christ (Lk 4.7).” They contest the idea that speaking in an “Islamophilic tone” will help those Christians who are suffering persecution in Muslim countries, professing that “apart from the fact that Jesus has never indicated any other way than that of the Cross, so that we must find our joy therein and not flee with all the damned, we do not doubt that only the proclamation of the Truth brings with it not only salvation, but freedom as well (John 8.32).”\nThe letter also contrasts the stance of Islamic countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia who “do not welcome any refugee” while Pope Francis preaches\nthe welcoming of migrants regardless of the fact that they are Muslims, something forbidden by Apostolic command: “If anyone comes to you but refuses this Gospel, do not receive him among you nor greet him.\nWhoever greets him participates in his evil works.” (2 John 1.10-11); “If anyone preaches to you a different Gospel, let him be accursed!” (Galatians 1.8-9)\nThe signatories go on to give voice to the utter scandal of the pope’s failure to carry out his evangelical mission as the Vicar of Christ to call home the members of the Islamic faith:\nThe pro-Islam speech of Your Holiness leads us to deplore the fact that Muslims are not invited to leave Islam, and that many ex-Muslims, such as Magdi Allam, are even leaving the Church, disgusted by her cowardice, wounded by equivocal gestures, confused by the lack of evangelization, scandalized by the praise given to Islam … Thus ignorant souls are misled…\nTaking the matter further, they warn, too, of the physical danger the pope’s disposition toward Islam invites, saying that it has resulted in Christians\nnot preparing for a confrontation with Islam, to which St. John Paul II has called them (Ecclesia in Europa, No.\n57).\nWe are under the impression that you do not take your brother Bishop Nona Amel, Chaldean-Catholic Archbishop of Mosul in exile, seriously, when he tells us: “Our present sufferings are the prelude to those that you, Europeans and Western Christians, will suffer in the near future.\nI have lost my diocese.\nThe headquarters of my archdiocese and my apostolate have been occupied by radical Islamists who want us to convert or die.\n(…) You are welcoming into your country an ever increasing number of Muslims.\nYou are in danger as well.\nYou must make strong and courageous decisions (…).\nYou think that all men are equal, but Islam does not say that all men are equal.\n(…) If you do not understand this very quickly, you will become the victims of the enemy that you have invited into your home.” (August 9, 2014) “.\nThis is a matter of life and death, and any complacency towards Islam is treasonous.\nWe do not wish the West to continue with Islamization, nor that your actions contribute to it.\nWhere then would we go to seek refuge?\nThe signatories plea is that the pope will “quickly convene a synod on the dangers of Islam.”\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"The Remnant Newspaper\n\nThe unmasking of McCarrick exposed the pervasive prelate coverup of homosexual sexual predation in the American Catholic Church.\nThese swarmy power brokers have colluded far too long at the tragic expense of innocent boys and seminarians.\nFor 60 years, Ted McCarrick roamed the halls of seminaries, harassing, raping, and assaulting young males around the world.\nHis brother bishops all knew and they all stayed silent.\nHow fortuitous and revelatory that McCarrick, the Molester would divulge his personal role in the pre-Conclave lobbying effort to elect Jorge Bergoglio as Pope.\nThe notorious lavender mafia anxiously sought a simpatico Pope to advance its reformist homosexual agenda.\nBergoglio was their man.\nThe now well known McCarrick Villanova Speech on October 13, 2013 where he relayed the story about a prominent Italian man who met with McCarrick to ask him to lobby for the election of Bergoglio to the papacy.\nIn light of the McCarrick scandal, the conversation takes on new meaning...\nMcCarrick described the conversation with the Influential Roman:\n“Before we went into the General Congregation, a very interesting and influential Italian gentleman came to see me at the Seminary (where else?)\nwhere I was staying.\nWe sat down and he’s a very brilliant man, very influential in Rome and said he had a favor to ask of me back home in the U.S., but then he said:”\nInfluential Roman: What about Bergoglio?\nMolester McCarrick: I was surprised and said, What about Bergoglio?\nInfluential Roman: Does he have a chance?\nMolester McCarrick: I don’t think so.\nNo one has mentioned his name.\nHe isn’t on anyone’s mind.\nInfluential Roman: He could do it you know.\nMolester McCarrick: What could he do?\nInfluential Roman: He could reform the Church.\nIf you gave him 5 years, he could get us back on target.\nHe’s 76.\nIf he had 5 years—the Lord working through him, he could make the Church over again.\nMolester McCarrick: That’s interesting.\nInfluential Roman: I know you are his friend.\nMolester McCarrick: I hope I am.\nInfluential Roman: Talk him up.\nMolester McCarrick'll vouch for ya, Francis!\n#bromance\nAnd talk him up, McCarrick the Molester did!\nOh, the irony!\nThat the most prolific serial predator Cardinal would divulge the pre-Conclave Bergoglio plot to “reform the Church.” Now we know what “reform the Church” looks like in the Bergoglian papacy.\nYes, the clever and tyrannical Bergoglio, through his manipulation of synods, footnotes, exhortations, personal phone calls, airplane pressers, and correspondence has nearly completed his task of modernizing the Roman Catholic Church in the past 5 years.\nThe rallying cry for his homosexual modern agenda was sounded in his July 29, 2013 airplane presser.\nWho am I to judge set the tone for merciful embrace of homosexual priests.\nAfter 5 long years, his unrelenting mercy mantra seemingly extends only to homosexual clerics, not to the laity or clergy victims who protest the cover ups by prelates.\nFrancis’ wink and nod to the homosexual lifestyle landed him on the cover of the Advocate, the gay magazine, as its Man of the Year.\nHe lapped up the accolades from the secular culture and main stream media.\nYet, fame is and predation is unrelenting, even for Popes.\nIn the words of Queen Elizabeth, this year has been annus horribilis for Francis.\nExcuse the gay slang pun but, the chickens have come home to roost.\nThe cascading revelations of papal sex scandals are toppling the barque of Peter.\nWill Catholic laity pay attention and take action?\nThe McCarrick scandal created an earthquake in the Catholic Church with aftershocks that will last for years.\nThe timing is eerily propitious and providential based on the 5 year deadline.\nWill the laity step up and reclaim our hijacked Catholic Church?\nThis critical time in the history of the Catholic Church demands that the laity step forward to protect the Church, its children and seminarians from predators.\nWe must close ranks before another precious child is exploited, a holy seminarian is violated, or another homosexual orgy is covered up at the Vatican.\nThe first order of business is to scuttle the upcoming October Synod on Young People, the Faith, and Vocational Discernment.\nRemember that influential Roman gentleman friend of McCarrick who said that Bergoglio could reform the Church in 5 years?\nBergoglio’s upcoming Synod on Young People will serve as the culminating vehicle for the 5 year modernist reform of the St. Gallen Mafia.\nThis Synod is designed to exploit the youth, like they’ve been doing for the last 60 years.\nIf it weren’t so infuriating, it would be laughable that following the McCarrick scandal of sexual predation of young males and seminarians, by a Cardinal, and covered up by Bishops, the Catholic Church would host a Synod of Bishops on the topic of young people and vocations!\nFurthermore, this nightmare of a “sinod\" is inviting youth from ages 16-29 to mingle with the Bishops to discuss the Church, faith and vocations.\nAre you thoroughly disgusted by this farce?\nThe Bishops have proven that they cannot be trusted to protect young people and seminarians from predators.\nThe ever growing global list of Bishops and Cardinals that have preyed on \/and or covered up the sexual abuse of minors and seminarians over the last 60 years continues to enrage the laity.\nWe are no longer Shocked, just fed up.\nLet’s start with the Cardinal who will lead the upcoming Synod, none other than Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Prefect of the Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life.\nAs the DC roommate and protege of Ted McCarrick, Farrell so respected McCarrick, the Molester, that he fashioned his Coat of Arms as a tribute to Uncle Ted.\nFarrell’s pathetic and laughable defense “I never knew anything about McCarrick” video highlights the continuing conspiracy of denial by the U.S. Catholic hierarchy.\nUndoubtedly, Farrell as the head of this Synod chose his dear friend gay friendly, Fr.\nJames Martin, S.J.\nto keynote the Synod.\nFarrell’s graciously offers notorious praise for Martin’s new book, Building a Bridge (to hell, ed.)\nexposes his obvious underlying homosexual agenda and aura of the upcoming Synod:\n“A welcome and much-needed book that will help bishops, priests, pastoral associates, and all church leaders more compassionately minister to the LGBT community.\nIt will also help LGBT Catholics feel more at home in what is, after all, their church.”\nWhat merciful praise for Martin’s book, Cardinal Farrell!\nContrary to the theme of mercy and compassion to LGBTs, it appears that your mentor, McCarrick set out to groom and grow an LGBT community.\nClearly, you and Fr.\nMartin have much in common since you both claimed you were “shocked” by the McCarrick allegations.\nExplain to Catholics why would you headline a homosexual affirming speaker at a Synod for youth and seminarians?\nIn case you haven’t been reading the McCarrick headlines or noticing the plunging mass attendance and collections, Catholics don’t trust their boys around priests and are furious that their seminarians are subjected to unrelenting homosexual sexual harassment.\nMcCarrick is the last straw.\nAll credibility is lost.\nThe October Synod is yet another example of Church leaders exploiting Catholic youth for their own personal power agenda and selfish motives.\nBergoglio’s five year plan is nearly complete.\nCatholics must shed their trust and naivety in the papacy and bishops’ conference.\nDare, if you will, to read the thrill, the excitement and anticipated results of the Synod in the radical New Ways Gay Catholic Ministry article, entitled, Youth Synod Document shows Vatican evolution on LGBT Topics.\nThe article highlights the New Ways excitement over the shift in the Vatican approach to the LGBT issues at the Synod:\n“Another significant development is the acknowledgement that LGBT people have a desire to be part of the church.\nIn one section, the document states: “some LGBT youth … wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care from the Church.” “This acknowledgement is a welcome change from the hierarchy’s traditional rhetoric that suggests LGBT people are opposed to religion.\nAs New Ways Ministry knows from over 40 years of pastoral work with the LGBT community, LGBT Catholics have a deep spirituality, often forged by remarkable journeys overcoming rejection, alienation, and marginalization.\nLGBT Catholics have stayed a part of the church, despite statements and actions which have offended and hurt them.”\nThe New Ways article highlights the efforts of Cardinal Kevin Farrell and his Vatican cronies to promote the LGBT agenda for the upcoming Synod:\n“A third development is that the document shows that Vatican officials paid attention to concerns about LGBT issues which were raised by youth at a pre-synod meeting in Rome during March of this year, and also from youth around the world who made their views known to the Vatican online.”\nAnd what of the infamous Instrumentum Laboris, drafted by the crafty Cardinal Baldisseri, Secretary General of the Synod of Bishops, noteworthy of the infamous First Synod on the Family?\nKnown for his manipulative polls and magical modernistic results, Baldisseri infamously stated that “dogma has its own evolution.” Baldisseri stayed true to his modernist form and agenda and to the delight of the New Ways Ministry, he announced at the Vatican press conference that his office is using for the first time ever the LGBT acronym to refer to gay people in a spirit of inclusion.\nLest there be any doubt about the secret agenda and outcome of this Synod, Cardinal Baldisseri raises the exclusion rainbow flag.\nBaldisseri notes that the upcoming Synod is to “make the entire Church aware of its important mission to accompany every young person, none excluded.”\nThis papacy is awash in the prissy, pop psycho speak, jargon of accompaniment, listening, and dialogue dazzling the media with empty tropes and luring the uncatechized into its globalist mantra of one world new age religion.\nNot surprisingly, Baldisseri never once mentions that dreaded word, dogma in the Instrumentum Laboris, but effuses about accompaniment 136 times!\nThis doltish and dimwitted document wreaks of psycho babble, insults the intelligence of young people, and will destroy the future of the Church.\nWelcome to the dumbing down of the Catholic Faith by the St. Gallen Mafia and their don, Jorge Bergoglio.\nThis Synod will exploit the youth and seminarians, just like Ted McCarrick.\nThe handwriting is all over the 37 foot Vatican wall.\nThe time to take a stand against this radical hijacking of Holy Mother Church is now.\nExpose and rout every last predator.\nPurge every homosexual from its clerical ranks.\n#StopTheSynod.\nIt has all the markings of a Gay Pride Rally.\n__________________________________________\nElizabeth Yore is an attorney and international child rights advocate who has

{"prompt":"National Data | December Jobs—TRUMP EFFECT!\nAmerican Worker Displacement, Immigrant Population, Black Unemployment ALL DECLINE!\n| Articles\n\n)\nForget the Wolff book brouhaha and Trump’s latest DACA dalliance —the real story is outside the Beltway , where real people live and work.\nDecember marked the fifth month in a row in which the immigrant working-age population ( legal and illegal declined from the same month of the prior year.\nSimultaneously, immigrant displacement of American workers fell, also apparently confirming a trend that began in September.\nAnd, by the way, black unemployment is at a record low.\nWhat started after the 2016 election as a reduction in the rate of increase in the foreign-born population of working age has turned into an outright retreat.\nThis is in dramatic contrast to the last months of the Obama Regime, which saw year-over-year increases in immigrant working-age population far in excess of the estimated 1 million legal immigrants admitted annually, and which I argued meant that an unreported illegal alien surge was underway.\nAccording to the Labor Department employment report released last Friday, December there were 77,000 fewer working-age immigrants (legal and illegal) in the country in December 2017 than in December 2016—a decline of 0.18%.\nThis follows year-over-year drops of 138,000 in August, 143,000 in September, and 117,000 in October, and 64,000 in November.\nNot since the Great Recession has the foreign-born working-age population declined for five consecutive months—but now, in telling contrast, the economy is expanding.\nThis makes the Trump Era immigrant workforce decline especially striking.\nNote that this is a net figure.\nThe year-over- year reduction in the immigrant working-age population does not mean new immigrants have stopped coming in.\nAbout 300,000 immigrants die annually, and an equal number leave (voluntarily or otherwise), according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies.\n[U.S.\nImmigrant Population Hit Record 43.7 Million in 2016, By Steven A. Camarota and Karen Zeigler,October 16, 2017] So the 77,000 reduction in working-age immigrants from December 2016 to December 2017 is consistent with a gross inflow of about 500,000 new foreign-born workers (legal and illegal) over that period—the gross inflow more than offset by the gross reduction of 600,000 due to deaths, deportations, and immigrant emigrants.\nThis helps explain why a reduction in the immigrant workforce population reduction is compatible with reports of a recent increase in illegal immigration on the U.S. southwest border (albeit still less than at the end of the Obama Regime).\nThe additional good news: Native-born American workers took all the jobs created this month, according to the Household Survey, which records workers’ immigrant status (but not their legal status).\nThe Household Survey reported 103,000 jobs were created last month—well below the 148,000 figure found by the far more widely-cited Payroll Survey.\nIn December 2017:\nImmigrant employment fell by 246,000, down by 0.93%\nNative-born American employment rose a whopping 349,000 – up 0.27%\nThe immigrant employment index, set to 100.0 in January 2009, fell from 122.0 to 120.9.\nThe native-born American employment index rose from 105.8 to 106.0..\nThe New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index (NVDAWDI), our term for the ratio of immigrant to native-born employment growth indexes, fell fromto(100X (120.9\/106.0))\nTrump may not have delivered (yet) on his promise to bring back the factory and coal jobs so many of his supporters lost during the Obama years.\nBut by shrinking the pool of immigrants willing to do that work, he has put more money in pockets of his voters.\nWhile overall wage growth remains modest – 2.5% per annum in December – Blue collar workers have beat this by a wide margin:\n“It is commonly said that wage stagnation contributed to an economic anxiety in middle America that carried Donald Trump into the White House…Yet Mr. Trump’s rise seems to have coincided with a turnaround in fortunes for the middle class.\n… The latest development—one that will be of particular interest to Mr. Trump—is that blue-collar wages have begun to rocket.\n…In the year [2017] to the third quarter, wage and salary growth for the likes of factory workers, builders and drivers easily outstripped that for professionals and managers.\nIn some cases, blue-collar pay growth now exceeds 4%…” Blue-collar wages are surging.\nCan it last?, The Economist, Magazine, November 14th 2017\nEleven months of Trump has not come close to undoing the damage done by eight years of Obama.\nNative-born American workers lost ground to their foreign-born competitors throughout the Obama years and this trend accelerated significantly in the months leading up to the election:\nCan't render, error\nNative-born American employment growth is represented by the black line, immigrant employment growth is in pink, and NVAWDI—the ratio of immigrant to native-born American job growth—is in blue.\nAnother way of looking at American worker displacement: the immigrant share of total U.S. employment rose steadily, albeit erratically, throughout the Obama years.\nIt fell sharply in the months after the 2016 election, but roared back to Obama-era levels in the spring.\nImmigrants held 16.99% of total jobs in December, a significant drop from November’s 17.16% share.\nCan't render, error\nA detailed snapshot of American worker displacement over the past year is available in the Employment Status of the Civilian Population by Nativity table published in the monthly BLS Report.\nOver the last 12 months (December 2016 to December 2017):\nThe native-born American labor force (employed plus looking for work) grew twice as fast as the immigrant labor force: 0.63% versus 0.30%.\nADVANTAGE AMERICANS\nas the immigrant labor force: 0.63% versus 0.30%.\nAmerican employment grew 57% faster than immigrant employment: 1.27% versus 0.81%.\nADVANTAGE AMERICANS\nThe labor-force participation rate (LPR), a sign of worker confidence and mobility, rose by 0.6 points for immigrants and was unchanged for native-born Americans.\nAt 65.3%, the immigrant LPR this December was considerably above the native-born American rate (61.9%.)\nADVANTAGE IMMIGRANTS\nThe number of unemployed Americans fell by 763,000—down 12.7%, while the number of unemployed immigrants fell 129,000—down by 11%.\nADVANTAGE AMERICANS\nAnother piece of good news, quite possibly connected to the shrinking of the immigrant working age population, caught our eye: The unemployment rate for black Americans fell to 6.8% in December , the lowest level since the Labor Department began tracking the figure in 1972.\n[ U.S. economy added 2 million jobs in 2017 , by Patrick Gillespie, CNNMoney, January 5, 2018]\nBy removing foreign competitors, Trump may have done more for blacks in 11 months than Obama did in eight years.\nOf course, this could be affected by statistical noise—and it could be undone by e.g.\na DACA capitulation.\nBut right now it increasingly appears the Trump Effect is real—and achieved entirely through enhanced enforcement.\nWhat could happen if the GOP-controlled Congress woke up and enacted an immigration moratorium?\nEdwin S.

Buchanan: Sorry, Jeff Flake, It's Trump's Party Now!\n| Articles\n\nMore is now required of us than to put down our thoughts in writing, declaimed Jeff Flake in his oration against President Trump, just before he announced he will be quitting the Senate.\nThough he had lifted the title of his August anti-Trump polemic, \"Conscience of a Conservative,\" from Barry Goldwater, Jeff Flake is no Barry Goldwater.\nGoldwater took on the GOP establishment in the primaries, voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, defiantly declared, \"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,\" and then went down to defeat battling to the end after the assassination of JFK made LBJ invincible.\nThe real \"Mr. Conservative\" was a true profile in courage.\nFlake, with only 18 percent approval in Arizona, decided to pack it in rather than get waxed in his own primary.\nWith Falstaff, Flake appears to believe that \"discretion is the better part of valor.\"\nSen. Bob Corker is another summertime soldier calling on colleagues to stand and fight Trump while he retires to Tennessee.\nIt's no wonder the establishment is viewed with such derision.\nFlake calls Trump \"dangerous to our democracy.\"\nBut the real threat Trump represents is to the GOP establishment's control of the party's agenda and the party's destiny.\nU.S. politics have indeed been coarsened, with Trump playing a lead role.\nYet, beneath the savagery of the uncivil war in the party lies more than personal insults and personality clashes.\nThis is a struggle about policy, about the future.\nAnd Trump is president because he read the party and the country right, while the Bush-McCain Republican establishment had lost touch with both.\nHow could the Beltway GOP not see that its defining policies — open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism, compulsive military intervention in foreign lands for ideological ends — were alienating its coalition?\nWhat had a quarter century of Bushite free trade produced?\nAbout $12 trillion in trade deficits, $4 trillion with China alone, a loss of 55,000 plants and 6 million manufacturing jobs.\nWe imported goods \"Made in China,\" while exporting our future.\nU.S. elites made China great again, to where Beijing is now challenging our strategic position and presence in Asia.\nCould Republicans not see the factories shutting down, or not understand why workers' wages had failed to rise for decades?\nWhat did the democracy crusades \"to end tyranny in our world\" accomplish?\nThousands of U.S. dead, tens of thousands of wounded, trillions of dollars sunk, and a Mideast awash in blood from Afghanistan to Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen, with millions uprooted and homeless.\nYet, still, the GOP establishment has not repudiated the mindset that produced this.\nWith the Cold War over for a quarter of a century, what is the case now for America, $20 trillion in debt, going abroad in search of monsters to destroy?\nConsider.\nBush-Obama \"open borders\" brought in tens of millions of Third World peoples, legally and illegally, to rising resistance from Americans forced to bear the economic and social costs.\nWhat was the GOP establishment's reply to the opposition to amnesty for illegals and calls for a moratorium on legal immigration, to assimilate the tens of millions already here?\nTo call them nativists and parade their moral superiority.\nFlake and Corker are being beatified by the Beltway elites, and George W. Bush and John McCain celebrated for their denunciations of Trumpism.\nYet no two people are more responsible for the blunders of the post-Cold War era than McCain and Bush.\nAbout which of half a dozen wars were they right?\nYesterday's New York Times recognized Trump's triumph:\n\"Despite the fervor of President Trump's Republican opponents, the president's brand of hard-edged nationalism—with its gut-level cultural appeals and hard lines on trade and immigration—is taking root within his adopted party.\"\nMoreover, a new question arises:\nCan the GOP establishment believe that if Trump falls, or they bring him down, they will inherit the estate and be welcomed home like the Prodigal Son?\nDo they believe their old agenda of open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism and democracy-crusading can become America's agenda again?\nTrumpism is not a detour, after which we can all get back on the interstate to the New World Order.\nFor though unpleasant, it is not unfair to say that if there was one desire common to Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump voters, it was be rid of the regime resting on top of all of us.\nShould Trump fall, and a restored establishment attempt to reimpose the old policies, there will be a truly uncivil war in this country.\nAfter the Trumpian revolt, there is no going back.\nAs that most American of writers, Thomas Wolfe, put it, \"You can't go home again.\"\nTraditionalists have been told that for years.\nNow it's the turn of the GOP establishment to learn the truth as well.\nGoldwater lost badly, but the establishment that abandoned him never had its patrimony restored.\nIt was the leaders they abhorred, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, to whom the future belonged.\nPatrick J.

{"prompt":"Ex-Sailor Pardoned By Trump Says He’s SUING Obama And Comey\n\nA former Navy sailor, who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump, is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials.\nKristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, says he was subject to unequal protection of the law.\nSaucier said that he realizes he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked.\nHe has also lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton’s emails.\nAccording to Fox News, Saucier argues that the same officials who sought out punishment to Saucier for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and mishandling of classified information.\nSaucier’s lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others.\nSaucier, who lives in Vermont, pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009.\nHe said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine’s propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera.\n–Fox News\n“They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,” Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, “but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton.\nHillary is still walking free.\nTwo guys on my ship did the same thing and weren’t treated as criminals.\nWe want them to correct the wrong.” Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December.\nThere is usually a six-month period that must elapse before the lawsuit actually is actually filed.\n“My case was usually something handled by military courts,” he said.\n“They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton,” he continued, alleging his life was ruined for political reasons.\n“With a pardon, there’s no magic wand that gets waved and makes everything right,” Saucier said, “But I try to stay positive and look forward.” Saucier has had cars repossessed and is in debt due to the loss of income after having a felony on his record.\nThe government actively destroyed his life an made it all but impossible for his family to get back on track.\nBut Hillary Clinton is running around free, to this day.\nAnd that is what Saucier is so burnt about, with good reason.\n>","completion":" Causal_Oversimplification|2312|2388\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|1831|1872\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|1905|1976\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2725|2782\nRepetition|2858|2862\nLoaded_Language|2921|2937."}
{"prompt":"Stop Appeasing the Democrats\n\nBruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center.\nFrom the playground to geopolitics, appeasing an aggressor invites only more aggression.\nThis timeless truth of human nature is one that we moderns can’t seem to accept.\nWe reflexively assume that a rational accommodation or concessions will be reciprocated by those proven to be ready to use any means necessary to achieve their aims, no matter how amoral, unfair, or vicious.\nBrett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court illustrate that this false assumption leads only to more demands, and ultimately to defeat.\nThe last-minute accusations from Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who claims that decades ago Kavanaugh groped her at a high school party, and Deborah Ramirez, who accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a frat party at Yale, are transparent acts of aggression against the judge and Republicans, one engineered by the Democrats.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein sat for months on Ford’s letter and then––just as the Dems did in 1991with Anita Hill’s charges of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas’s during his hearings––released it only when Kavanaugh appeared to be heading for confirmation.\nFeinstein still hasn’t given the Judiciary Committee an unredacted copy of the letter.\nA few weeks after Ford went public, and after Kavanaugh said he had dairies from that summer detailing his whereabouts, The New Yorker published Ramirez’s account of a drunken party filled with obscene drinking games where he exposed himself to Ramirez.\nGiven that the Democrats had made public in advance their intention to derail the hearings and confirmation by any means possible, the timing of both sexual assault charges reeks of premeditated contrivance intended to delay confirmation as long as possible.\nBut in the face of this naked ploy to bork Kavanaugh and derail the confirmation process for partisan advantage, the Republicans seem to be reverting to their customary preemptive cringe.\nAll the Dems have to do is squeal “sexism” and Republicans start negotiating and offering concessions.\nOf course, after each concession comes another demand.\nFirst the Dems demanded that Ford, a long-time Democrat activist, “be heard.” So last week the Chairman of Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, granted another deadline extension for Ford to decide whether to testify before the Committee on Monday.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein calls these concessions “bullying deadlines.” As Feinstein put it, “Show some heart.\nWait until Dr. Ford feels that she can come before the committee.” Ford doesn’t “feel” like she can testify on Monday because she’s afraid of flying, despite offers from the Committee to travel to her in California.\nThen she feared for her life because of death threats ––threats also made to Kavanaugh, his wife and two young daughters–– so she now demands enhanced security measures.\nThe Committee caved and moved the date to Thursday.\nSo of course, Grassley having been intimidated into giving Ford a chance to address the Committee, Ramirez and her handlers are now demanding the same privilege.\n“Creepy Lawyer” for porn star Stormy Daniels claims to represent a woman who also should be allowed to testify to the Senate Committee about Kavanaugh’s partying habits while at Yale.\nWe’ll have to see whether Grassley can find the stomach to put an end to the farce of allowing unsubstantiated charges from Democrat activists to waste the Committee’s time.\nFord and Dianne Feinstein also keep demanding an FBI investigation, even though no federal crime is being alleged, and any investigation 36 years after the offense is impossible.\nFord can’t remember where and when the alleged assault took place, nor how she got to or went home from the party where it allegedly occurred.\nHer own details of the event don’t jibe (Four boys or three?\nOne girl or two?).\nShe told no one about the assault until 30 years later.\nA “lifelong friend” whom Ford claims was at the party has denied any knowledge of the it, and says she’s never met Kavanaugh.\nAnother friend who reported that the school was abuzz with gossip about the attack (which apparently took place during summer break), retracted her statement.\nThe two men Ford named as possible witnesses to the assault have contradicter her claims under oath.\nAnd the accused Judge Kavanaugh also under oath vehemently denies the charges.\nGiven that 36 years have passed since the incident, and the accuser’s memory is so hazy and short on coherent details, the FBI has nothing to investigate.\nRamirez’s charge is even flimsier.\nHere’s a catalogue from the Daily Wire:\n1.\nThe New Yorker could not find a single witness who could put Kavanaugh at the alleged party.\n2.\nThe New York Times could not find a single person who could corroborate Ramirez’s claims.\n3.\nThe man accused of egging on Kavanaugh denied Ramirez's allegations and vouched for Kavanaugh’s character.\n4.\nA third person that Ramirez claimed was at the party says she was not there for the alleged incident.\n5.\nRamirez contacted her former classmates, asking about the incident, and admitted she was not sure that Kavanaugh was the male who exposed himself.\n6.\nA woman who claims she was “best friends” with Ramirez says Ramirez never mentioned the story and initially said her friend's accusations against Kavanaugh might be “politically motivated.”\n7.\nRamirez, just like Christine Blasey Ford, is a registered Democrat and is dedicated to leftist causes.\n8.\nRamirez wasn’t even sure her memory was correct — until she spent six days going over it with her Democrat lawyer.\n9.\nRamirez admits there are holes in her memory due to how much she drank at the party.\n10.\nPeople who knew Ramirez after her time at Yale say that she never once mentioned the incident — until Kavanaugh's nomination was pending.\nNo law enforcement agency, let alone the FBI, would waste its time with an allegation of a crime decades in the past, and so patently incoherent and lacking in evidence.\nThe “FBI investigation” is another delaying tactic.\nFord has finally agreed to testify, set for Thursday for now.\nBut it’s unclear whether Grassley has granted Ford any of her preposterous conditions for testifying: She will take questions from the Committee, but not from outside lawyers, who might not be as gentle as politicians with one eye on the polls.\nOnly one camera can be in the room.\nKavanaugh must testify first, a grotesque inversion of our bedrock principle that an accused has the right to confront his accuser’s charges.\nHe can’t be in the room with her, apparently because she’s still traumatized and may start experiencing flashbacks.\nSo much for “I am woman, hear me roar.”\nGrassley shouldn’t cave on these conditions.\nThey all comprise the old tactic of serially escalating demands that cannot be satisfied in order to compel your enemy to give in.\nThat Grassley and the Republicans would even participate in this absurd show trial is testimony to how deeply the progressive ideological narrative has burrowed into our social and political life.\nIf Ford actually testifies on Thursday, or Ramirez is granted the same concession, nothing material will be gained.\nHer accusation will not be proved true or false.\nWe will learn nothing about Kavanaugh that makes him any less eminently qualified for the Supreme Court, nothing that can add to the thousands of pages of documents already presented to the Committee, or the hundreds of hours of the judge’s testimony before rabid partisans and office-seekers.\nBut vetting Kavanaugh’s qualifications isn’t the point.\nThe point is to delay confirmation by slandering Kavanaugh and baiting the Republicans into appearing to abuse victims of sexual assault.\nWhy?\nFacing his likely confirmation, the Dems, egged on by the mainstream media––especially The New Yorker, which published a story too badly sourced even for The New York Times–– are desperately attempting to obstruct and delay the process until after the midterm elections, when they hope they will retake the Senate and thus stop any more Constitutionalist judges from being confirmed to the Court for the rest of Trump’s term.\nThe Democrats have stooped so low with these smears because they know the stakes.\nThe courts and especially the Supreme Court have been critical to the progressives’ program since Woodrow Wilson.\nThe biggest obstacle to the progressive dream of government controlled and managed by a technocratic oligarchy has been the Constitution.\nIts divided and balanced powers were designed precisely to rein in overreaching ambition and concentrations of power.\nHence the Constitutional order must be subverted by the Supreme Court and its unaccountable justices enjoying lifelong tenure.\nBut if Kavanaugh is confirmed, there will be five reliably Constitutionalist justices on the bench, who are unlikely to tolerate judicial usurpation of Congress’s law-making powers.\nThat’s why this current nomination is a hill the Dems are willing to beclown themselves on.\nGiven how obviously partisan and hypocritical this ploy is––doesn’t Keith Ellison’s accuser deserve to be heard and believed too?\n––why has Grassley so far allowed himself to be played by the Dems?\nBecause Republicans fear the backlash from all those women voters who presumably agree with the fundamentalist feminists, and insist that every accusation of sexual assault, no matter how much it’s unsupported by corroborating evidence or even plausibility, must be believed.\nThis contention itself is an expression of the radical feminist narrative of innate male feral sexuality that makes them sexual predators.\nThe irony is that today’s feminists have been willing to sacrifice the earlier narrative of female power and agency that had been stifled by traditional views of the sexes and their capabilities.\nInstead, now women are Victorian hothouse flowers too delicate to make their way through their lives without the paternal federal government protecting them with its coercive power.\nWomen have exchanged one form of dependence, and one double standard for another.\nThe Dems are using Ford and Ramirez as part of the Democrats’ transparently dishonest delaying tactics because they know that most Republicans have accepted this duplicitous feminist narrative and fear challenging it.\nEspecially after the recent spate of sexual assault charges––many of them true, some false, others contested–– politicians consider bucking the narrative to be as politically suicidal as proposing to reform Social Security and Medicare.\nIt’s the new third rail of American politics, one that transcends party affiliation.\nHence the widespread virtue-signaling on the part even of conservative writers who preface their comments about Ford and Ramirez with prologues full of truisms about how horrible sexual assault is, how its self-proclaimed victims “must be heard,” and how churlish and sexist it is to question the truth of any charge.\nGrown-ups know all that and don’t have to be reminded every time the subject arises.\nThe Dems know that most Republicans come to this conflict with the huge disadvantage that results from accepting your opponent’s dubious ideology and dishonest narrative.\nThe progressive party can dare the Republicans to ignore the endless specious demands, stop the show-trial, and proceed to a vote on Kavanaugh, because they know the Republicans, fearful of the “optics,” will cave.\nThey know that the eleven male Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee dread the #MeToo movement casting them as knuckle-dragging Neanderthal sexists who want to “silence” the accuser with their “cavalier treatment of a sexual assault survivor,” as one Ford lawyer has said.\nRepublicans still don’t get that no amount of appeasement will stop the left from demonizing them anyway.\nJust ask Boy Scout Mitt Romney, who was savaged for his innocuous “binders full of women.”\nAnd don’t forget, the old sorta, kinda moderate Democrats like Feinstein and Chuck Schumer, who now have joined the crowd of trendoid socialists armed with torches and pitch-forks, will go along because they’re frightened of their party’s increasingly rabid left-wing base.\nWhat can we do to end these confirmation circuses?\nJust stop holding them.\nThere’s nothing in the Constitution that says the Senate’s power to give “advice and consent” to the president regarding his nominee must entail days of televised hearings replete with caterwauling protestors and grandstanding Senators who’ve already made-up their minds.\nInvite written questions from the Senate, then schedule one day for the nominee to respond.\nDon’t put it on television, but make public a written transcript.\nRemove the television cameras, and attention-craving, politically ambitious Senators will be gone like a cool breeze.\nFor now, Grassley needs to end this farce if Ford doesn’t show up on Thursday or continues to negotiate for more delays and concessions.\nNo more concessions.\nNo more delays.\nNo more ceding control of the process to Democrat Party lawyers.\nDon’t give Ramirez the time of day.\nHold the vote no later than Thursday, or Friday if Ford does show up.\nMake Senators go on the record with their votes, and hold them to account in November.\nPut to the test the Dems’ claims that a critical mass of women, many of them with sons they don’t want falsely accused, believes the fundamentalist feminist narrative and will vote accordingly.\nTo borrow Churchill’s definition of appeasement, stop feeding the alligator in the hopes that you will be eaten last.\nFor fifty years the Democrats have proven they will demonize conservatives as racist and sexist no matter how often they bow and scrape.\nHow about acting on principle for a change and shoot the alligator.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange\n\nIt is welcome that finally there has been a little pushback, including from leading journalists, to the Guardian’s long-running vilification of Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks.\nReporter Luke Harding’s latest article, claiming that Donald Trump’s disgraced former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly visited Assange in Ecuador’s embassy in London on three occasions, is so full of holes that even hardened opponents of Assange in the corporate media are struggling to stand by it.\nFaced with the backlash, the Guardian quickly – and very quietly – rowed back its initial certainty that its story was based on verified facts.\nInstead, it amended the text, without acknowledging it had done so, to attribute the claims to unnamed, and uncheckable, “sources”.\nThe propaganda function of the piece is patent.\nIt is intended to provide evidence for long-standing allegations that Assange conspired with Trump, and Trump’s supposed backers in the Kremlin, to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race.\nThe Guardian’s latest story provides a supposedly stronger foundation for an existing narrative: that Assange and Wikileaks knowingly published emails hacked by Russia from the Democratic party’s servers.\nIn truth, there is no public evidence that the emails were hacked, or that Russia was involved.\nCentral actors have suggested instead that the emails were leaked from within the Democratic party.\nNonetheless, this unverified allegation has been aggressively exploited by the Democratic leadership because it shifts attention away both from its failure to mount an effective electoral challenge to Trump and from the damaging contents of the emails.\nThese show that party bureaucrats sought to rig the primaries to make sure Clinton’s challenger for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, lost.\nTo underscore the intended effect of the Guardian’s new claims, Harding even throws in a casual and unsubstantiated reference to “Russians” joining Manafort in supposedly meeting Assange.\nManafort has denied the Guardian’s claims, while Assange has threatened to sue the Guardian for libel.\n‘Responsible for Trump’\nThe emotional impact of the Guardian story is to suggest that Assange is responsible for four years or more of Trump rule.\nBut more significantly, it bolsters the otherwise risible claim that Assange is not a publisher – and thereby entitled to the protections of a free press, as enjoyed by the Guardian or the New York Times – but the head of an organisation engaged in espionage for a foreign power.\nThe intention is to deeply discredit Assange, and by extension the Wikileaks organisation, in the eyes of right-thinking liberals.\nThat, in turn, will make it much easier to silence Assange and the vital cause he represents: the use of new media to hold to account the old, corporate media and political elites through the imposition of far greater transparency.\nThe Guardian story will prepare public opinion for the moment when Ecuador’s rightwing government under President Lenin Moreno forces Assange out of the embassy, having already withdrawn most of his rights to use digital media.\nIt will soften opposition when the UK moves to arrest Assange on self-serving bail violation charges and extradites him to the US.\nAnd it will pave the way for the US legal system to lock Assange up for a very long time.\nFor the best part of a decade, any claims by Assange’s supporters that avoiding this fate was the reason Assange originally sought asylum in the embassy was ridiculed by corporate journalists, not least at the Guardian.\nEven when a United Nations panel of experts in international law ruled in 2016 that Assange was being arbitrarily – and unlawfully – detained by the UK, Guardian writers led efforts to discredit the UN report.\nSee here and here.\nNow Assange and his supporters have been proved right once again.\nAn administrative error this month revealed that the US justice department had secretly filed criminal charges against Assange.\nHeavy surveillance\nThe problem for the Guardian, which should have been obvious to its editors from the outset, is that any visits by Manafort would be easily verifiable without relying on unnamed “sources”.\nGlenn Greenwald is far from alone in noting that London is possibly the most surveilled city in the world, with CCTV cameras everywhere.\nThe environs of the Ecuadorian embassy are monitored especially heavily, with continuous filming by the UK and Ecuadorian authorities and most likely by the US and other actors with an interest in Assange’s fate.\nThe idea that Manafort or “Russians” could have wandered into the embassy to meet Assange even once without their trail, entry and meeting being intimately scrutinised and recorded is simply preposterous.\nAccording to Greenwald: “If Paul Manafort … visited Assange at the Embassy, there would be ample amounts of video and other photographic proof demonstrating that this happened.\nThe Guardian provides none of that.”\nFormer British ambassador Craig Murray also points out the extensive security checks insisted on by the embassy to which any visitor to Assange must submit.\nAny visits by Manafort would have been logged.\nIn fact, the Guardian obtained the embassy’s logs in May, and has never made any mention of either Manafort or “Russians” being identified in them.\nIt did not refer to the logs in its latest story.\nMurray:\nThe problem with this latest fabrication is that [Ecuador’s President] Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry.\nNeither Manafort nor these “Russians” are in the visitor logs … What possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort?\nFurthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency – who were in charge of the security – would not know the identity of these alleged “Russians”.\nNo fact-checking\nIt is worth noting it should be vitally important for a serious publication like the Guardian to ensure its claims are unassailably true – both because Assange’s personal fate rests on their veracity, and because, even more importantly, a fundamental right, the freedom of the press, is at stake.\nGiven this, one would have expected the Guardian’s editors to have insisted on the most stringent checks imaginable before going to press with Harding’s story.\nAt a very minimum, they should have sought out a response from Assange and Manafort before publication.\nNeither precaution was taken.\nI worked for the Guardian for a number of years, and know well the layers of checks that any highly sensitive story has to go through before publication.\nIn that lengthy process, a variety of commissioning editors, lawyers, backbench editors and the editor herself, Kath Viner, would normally insist on cuts to anything that could not be rigorously defended and corroborated.\nAnd yet this piece seems to have been casually waved through, given a green light even though its profound shortcomings were evident to a range of well-placed analysts and journalists from the outset.\nThat at the very least hints that the Guardian thought they had “insurance” on this story.\nAnd the only people who could have promised that kind of insurance are the security and intelligence services – presumably of Britain, the United States and \/ or Ecuador.\nIt appears the Guardian has simply taken this story, provided by spooks, at face value.\nEven if it later turns out that Manafort did visit Assange, the Guardian clearly had no compelling evidence for its claims when it published them.\nThat is profoundly irresponsible journalism – fake news – that should be of the gravest concern to readers.\nA pattern, not an aberration\nDespite all this, even analysts critical of the Guardian’s behaviour have shown a glaring failure to understand that its latest coverage represents not an aberration by the paper but decisively fits with a pattern.\nGlenn Greenwald, who once had an influential column in the Guardian until an apparent, though unacknowledged, falling out with his employer over the Edward Snowden revelations, wrote a series of baffling observations about the Guardian’s latest story.\nFirst, he suggested it was simply evidence of the Guardian’s long-standing (and well-documented) hostility towards Assange.\n“The Guardian, an otherwise solid and reliable paper, has such a pervasive and unprofessionally personal hatred for Julian Assange that it has frequently dispensed with all journalistic standards in order to malign him.”\nIt was also apparently evidence of the paper’s clickbait tendencies:\n“They [Guardian editors] knew that publishing this story would cause partisan warriors to excitedly spread the story, and that cable news outlets would hyperventilate over it, and that they’d reap the rewards regardless of whether the story turned out to be true or false.”\nAnd finally, in a bizarre tweet, Greenwald opined, “I hope the story [maligning Assange] turns out true” – apparently because maintenance of the Guardian’s reputation is more important than Assange’s fate and the right of journalists to dig up embarrassing secrets without fear of being imprisoned.\nI think the Guardian is an important paper with great journalists.\nI hope the story turns out true.\nBut the skepticism over this story is very widespread, including among Assange's most devoted haters, because it's so sketchy.\nIf Manafort went there, there's video.\nLet's see it.\n— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) November 28, 2018\nDeeper malaise\nWhat this misses is that the Guardian’s attacks on Assange are not exceptional or motivated solely by personal animosity.\nThey are entirely predictable and systematic.\nRather than being the reason for the Guardian violating basic journalistic standards and ethics, the paper’s hatred of Assange is a symptom of a deeper malaise in the Guardian and the wider corporate media.\nEven aside from its decade-long campaign against Assange, the Guardian is far from “solid and reliable”, as Greenwald claims.\nIt has been at the forefront of the relentless, and unhinged, attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for prioritising the rights of Palestinians over Israel’s right to continue its belligerent occupation.\nOver the past three years, the Guardian has injected credibility into the Israel lobby’s desperate efforts to tar Corbyn as an anti-semite.\nSee here, here and here.\nSimilarly, the Guardian worked tirelessly to promote Clinton and undermine Sanders in the 2016 Democratic nomination process – another reason the paper has been so assiduous in promoting the idea that Assange, aided by Russia, was determined to promote Trump over Clinton for the presidency.\nThe Guardian’s coverage of Latin America, especially of populist leftwing governments that have rebelled against traditional and oppressive US hegemony in the region, has long grated with analysts and experts.\nIts especial venom has been reserved for leftwing figures like Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez, democratically elected but official enemies of the US, rather than the region’s rightwing authoritarians beloved of Washington.\nThe Guardian has been vocal in the so-called “fake news” hysteria, decrying the influence of social media, the only place where leftwing dissidents have managed to find a small foothold to promote their politics and counter the corporate media narrative.\nThe Guardian has painted social media chiefly as a platform overrun by Russian trolls, arguing that this should justify ever-tighter restrictions that have so far curbed critical voices of the dissident left more than the right.\nHeroes of the neoliberal order\nEqually, the Guardian has made clear who its true heroes are.\nCertainly not Corbyn or Assange, who threaten to disrupt the entrenched neoliberal order that is hurtling us towards climate breakdown and economic collapse.\nIts pages, however, are readily available to the latest effort to prop up the status quo from Tony Blair, the man who led Britain, on false pretences, into the largest crime against humanity in living memory – the attack on Iraq.\nThat “humanitarian intervention” cost the lives of many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and created a vacuum that destabilised much of the Middle East, sucked in Islamic jihadists like al-Qaeda and ISIS, and contributed to the migrant crisis in Europe that has fuelled the resurgence of the far-right.\nNone of that is discussed in the Guardian or considered grounds for disqualifying Blair as an arbiter of what is good for Britain and the world’s future.\nThe Guardian also has an especial soft spot for blogger Elliot Higgins, who, aided by the Guardian, has shot to unlikely prominence as a self-styled “weapons expert”.\nLike Luke Harding, Higgins invariably seems ready to echo whatever the British and American security services need verifying “independently”.\nHiggins and his well-staffed website Bellingcat have taken on for themselves the role of arbiters of truth on many foreign affairs issues, taking a prominent role in advocating for narratives that promote US and NATO hegemony while demonising Russia, especially in highly contested arenas such as Syria.\nThat clear partisanship should be no surprise, given that Higgins now enjoys an “academic” position at, and funding from, the Atlantic Council, a high-level, Washington-based think-tank founded to drum up support for NATO and justify its imperialist agenda.\nImprobably, the Guardian has adopted Higgins as the poster-boy for a supposed citizen journalism it has sought to undermine as “fake news” whenever it occurs on social media without the endorsement of state-backed organisations.\nThe truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange, or in its much longer-running campaign to vilify him.\nWith this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake – it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative.\nIts job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing, neoliberal order: whether they are a platform like Wikileaks promoting whistle-blowing against a corrupt western elite; or a politician like Jeremy Corbyn seeking to break apart the status quo on the rapacious financial industries or Israel-Palestine; or a radical leader like Hugo Chavez who threatened to overturn a damaging and exploitative US dominance of “America’s backyard”; or social media dissidents who have started to chip away at the elite-friendly narratives of corporate media, including the Guardian.\nThe Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence.\nIt did what it is designed to do.\nUPDATE: Excellent background from investigative journalist Gareth Porter, published shortly before Harding’s story, explains why the Guardian’s hit-piece is so important for those who want Assange out of the embassy and behind bars.\nRead Porter’s article here.\nNo one pays me to write these blog posts.\nIf you appreciated it, or any of the others, please consider hitting the donate

{"prompt":"Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”\n\nWell, it’s been quite a couple of news weeks for the Catholic Church, hey?\nMcCarrick, Pineda\/Maradiaga, Fr.\nJames Larkin getting the boot in Dublin for upholding Catholic teaching on abortion… I know some people are, to put it bluntly, freaking out.\nThe anger of the laity over the McCarrick situation is boiling over into the Twitter feed of the people we still call “the good bishops”.\nBishop Thomas Tobin of Providence RI, - nicknamed the “Good Tobin” in contrast to the “Bad Tobin” and FrancisCardinal, Joseph Tobin of Newark – got quite an earful when he tweeted the other day, “Despite the egregious offenses of a few, and despite the faults and sins we all have, I’m very proud of my brother bishops and I admire and applaud the great work they do everyday for Christ and His Church.”\nThe replies haven’t topped out yet, at 121, nearly all of them expressing outrage at this cavalier attitude toward the revelation that Cardinal McCarrick has been proven to be a life-long homosexual rapist and sexual predator, grooming and trapping young men and children into unwanted sexual contact; and that nearly the entire episcopate of the United States either colluded directly or kept quiet about it.\nIt’s clear that even the “good bishops” have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out of their own churches by furious mobs.\nAs I wrote elsewhere, since 2002, most Catholics know perfectly well, despite the lame whitewashing attempt, that “the US bishops gave themselves a pass” on clerical sex abuse with the Dallas Charter “a thing that brazenly shifted blame.” And it seems that though they’re still doing this, quite a few lay Catholics just aren’t having it.\nWe are seeing the final slide, the expected and inevitable result of the last 100 years.\nThe Church was infiltrated, we know this, in the 19th century by some pretty dark forces, and they have finally come into the ascendancy and are showing themselves quite clearly for what they are.\nThe McCarrick news – and all the stuff swirling around it like the latest about Bishop Pineda and his connection to Pope Francis through Cardinal Maradiaga – has not come in contrast to this but as an intrinsic part of it.\nThe scandal of McCarrick is simply a toxic emission, a venting of the gasses that build up naturally around any rotting thing.\nRod Dreher[1] is doing excellent work compiling testimony from priests and others saying out loud at last what many of us had known for many years about McCarrick and his gang.\nIt has shown the world what Traditionalists have known, that it is emphatically NOT the result of one “bad apple” or even only a “few” as the hapless “conservative” Bishop Tobin tried to claim on Twitter.\nThis is the result of a mass-collusion.\nAs our friend Steve Skojec put it the other day, “We’ve got to stop pretending it’s just the progressive element in the Church.\nThe ‘conservatives’ are complicit, too.” In short, as it was during his days of glory, globe trotting on the dime of the State Department, hosting presidents for dinner and inviting John Paul II and Mother Theresa to tea, so it is now: McCarrick is the face of the New Paradigm.\nWhether he now has to go live in obscurity in some beach house in the Caymans, it will remain true: McCarrick is the “New Church.”\nA point that Dreher’s informants have brought up needs to be made emphatic: the homosexualist cabal that is currently reported to be dominant in the Catholic hierarchy (and don’t imagine this is confined to the United States or even to the English speaking world) have a well documented methodology of mutual protection-and-threat that keeps the whole apparatus afloat.\nIn briefest and simplest possible terms, immoral or even illegal sexual activity is preferred because it leaves a man open to blackmail, to control through fear of exposure[2].\nWhen that blackmailing culture becomes ascendant, it will always reject the morally upright as too dangerous, too difficult to control.\nThis is why faithful seminarians are rejected and why faithful priests are harassed.\nAs Dreher reported,\nWhen predatory gay priests run seminaries, they select on a bias for gay candidates...\nGay seminarians who intend to be celibate, Sipe said, face tremendous pressure to have sex.\nIf they slip up even once, their failure will be noted, and shared… And they will be made to understand that their lapse is remembered.\nLater, as a priest, predators within the priesthood have that knowledge to hold over the heads of other gay priests, to keep them silent if they ever have the desire to blow whistles.\nWhen I was covering the scandal in the early 2000s, I spoke to several, unconnected heterosexual men — priests, former priests, seminarians — who said that gay seminary rectors or diocesan officials encouraged them to take female sexual partners, so that they too would be complicit in sexual secret-keeping, and therefore no longer [be] a potential danger.\nNothing in a system like that is a greater threat to the corrupt than men who are not corrupt.\nFor many priests, one might say all good priests, this is not a sustainable situation, to say the least.\nI’ve had quite a few conversations with priests who are now asking how to deal with it.\nHow are they to continue to offer the sacraments in this situation?\nWhere are they to live?\nHow are they to maintain themselves?\nThese are the priests who did make it through this institutional gauntlet, who remain faithful now but are still under the control of these often grossly corrupt and evil men.\nAs men known to be incorruptible themselves, there is a big target painted on their backs.\nIn short, not only can a bad bishop harry a man out of his ministry, he has complete control over the priest’s material life.\nThe bishop can, with the flick of a pen or a single phone call, render a priest homeless, penniless and jobless.\nAnd these, remember, are men, often well on in years, whose only education and employment training has likely been academic degrees in philosophy and theology, and whose only professional contacts are ecclesiastical.\nMoreover, because of the globalisation of the bishop-network, a man blackballed for his authentic Catholicity will be a pariah in every diocese in the world.\nAnd with the advent of Bergoglio in Rome, there are no more havens; as many of the former Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate have learned, the blackballing has gone global with this pontificate.\nHe will remain a pariah even among the so-called “good” bishops who live in terror of the immense power of the cabal… (see above re: McCarrick & President Bush\/John Paul II.)\nI have been hearing from priests who are saying in effect, “We’re trapped in this situation and forced to remain silent because if we don’t we’ll not only be unable to function as priests, but we’ll be homeless and penniless.\nWe’re unemployable in any other field.” And as much as we might be tempted to say, “Well suck it up, this is for the good of souls,” the reality is that these are not small considerations.\nMany priests are getting older – many of them with health issues – and a man who has already given 20 or 30 years of his life to the Church is faced with a practical impossibility if he finds himself blacklisted.\nOf course there are some who don’t fit this mould; there are a lot of second careers in the priesthood and plenty of people go into seminary after some years in the normal workforce and can go back to it at need.\nSome of the men now coming forward with complaints against McCarrick, who left the priesthood over their experiences, have gone on to have normal, healthy working lives.\nBut I think honestly most priests are in this corner and they know it and so do their bishops.\nI think a young man goes forward in great faith, spends ten to fifteen years studying philosophy and theology - fields that have almost no application in the workforce outside academia or the Church - with the honest, and frankly fair, expectation of a lifetime of employment and a safety net at the end.\nAs one of them said to me, “The old arrangement was, ‘Remain faithful, do the work, and we will look after you.\nWe’ll house, feed and clothe you and look after your retirement.’ The new arrangement is a perversion of that: ‘Keep quiet and go along with it all and you’ll be fine, but step an inch out of line and we’ll destroy you.’”\nSo what do we do?\nThe Old Paradigm is destroyed and going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else.\nAs we saw in Ireland this week, the Purge has started.\nIt’s not enough to simply demand that a priest continue in his ministry no matter what.\nWe need to start working together with faithful priests – while there still are some – to help them create practical material alternatives.\nIf we who still love the Church want priests to be faithful, and even to start denouncing the evil and corruption they see, we are going to have to help them create a modicum of independence and security in which to do it.\nThe other day the American conservative writer, John Zmirak, wrote a sound suggestion on Twitter that I think it’s time we all started taking seriously.\nIn response to the continued outrages of both “good” and bad bishops, Zmirak suggested establishing “an escrow fund in each scandal-plagued diocese, where laymen [can] deposit the funds they would have donated to [the] local church, until [a] new bishop [is] appointed.”\nI responded: “And the money could be used to purchase properties to house faithful priests punished by their bishops for refusing the New Paradigm.\nWe could even perhaps buy a few convents so contemplative nuns could continue to pray in peace, without harassment from the evil men in Rome.”\nI am hearing lately from laymen who are starting to talk about setting up financial structures to ensure that the authentic Catholic life can be maintained through what is obviously soon to be a general collapse of the institution.\nThis would mean independent non-profit foundations that could build or buy church buildings, convents and even schools and provide salaries for priests and other staff.\nI started thinking about this recently when I received a note from a reader with a link to an online petition from Germany, addressed to the German bishops [!!!]\n“begging” those manifestly evil and apostate men not to close a famous and ancient monastic house.\nI responded that this was going about things the wrong way.\nCatholics are going to have to get their heads out of the mindset that they are helpless petitioners, “begging” the hierarchy to maintain the Faith.\nFirst of all, it only gives them a frisson of pleasure to see us groveling and begging for mercy.\nLet’s not give them that, OK?\nThere’s already enough “frissons of pleasure” in their lives.\nSecond, it’s simply not going to work.\nIn Germany, in the US, in Canada, in Italy, in Britain… throughout the Church in the 1st world, and in much of it elsewhere, the men in charge of the “institutional Church” – that is, whose names are on the bank accounts – are dedicated to the destruction of everything we want to preserve.\nThe wolves are now looking with ravening eyes at the faithful.\nThey are, in short, our enemies.\nThey’ve become so by making themselves the enemies of Christ and His Holy Church.\nThey know it and it’s time we stopped imagining otherwise.\nThe other suggestion I have is for young men interested in the priesthood to fortify themselves not only spiritually but in the material sphere.\nThere’s one big vulnerability we can guard against pretty easily.\nNo one should be facing penury and permanent unemployment because he’s a faithful Catholic.\nWe should never be letting any young man go into any diocesan seminary without being a property owner.\nHe should own a house or stand to inherit one.\nFamilies have to come to see this as a duty to the child and to the Church.\nAnd more than that, the potential priest needs to have job skills that have nothing to do with the priesthood.\nAmong the working classes there is a bias against intellectual work.\nBut most working class people have a pretty sensible attitude towards ambitions in academia: get something under your belt you can fall back on.\nHow many philosophy PhDs can build himself a bookshelf?\nChange the oil in a car?\nRewire a house?\nThe standard cliché of young people with useless academic degrees working at Starbucks has become so common it’s not even worth memeing anymore.\nHow many young men do we foresee being forced out of seminary for having the wrong “sexual orientation”?\nEvery one of those guys needs to be able to snap his fingers in the face of the rector and walk straight into a decent job, based not on any recommendation from a corrupt bishop, but on his solid skills.\nAmong the white collar classes there is a bias against blue collar work, but the trades are crying out for skilled men and a trade school diploma in fixing tractors is a lot cheaper and a lot faster to get than a university degree.\nThat’s an economic asset that we can’t afford to turn up our well-educated noses at.\nDon't miss Hilary White's next article in the July 31 Print Edition of The Remnant Newspaper; Subscribe today!\n\n\nIt reminds me of a discussion I had some years ago with the prior of a Benedictine monastery that is attracting a lot of young vocations.\nOne kid wanted to join and told me they had recommended he go to some college or other to study philosophy first.\nThis college, apparently, waives much of the tuition and gives work studies to people going for the priesthood and religious life so they can avoid the student loan trap.\nThis is fine, good idea.\nBut I asked him what he knew how to do.\n“Can you fix a bathroom pipe?\nDo you know anything about what to feed a sheep or how to care for a cow?\nCan you drive a tractor?” This nice kid, who certainly does have a vocation, could read books and look things up on the internet and write a pretty mean paper on Thomas Aquinas, but not a lot else.\nThere is going to have to be a shift in attitude in our remaining faithful institutions.\nDoes a monastery really need all of its members to have PhDs in philosophy and theology?\nWouldn’t it also be useful to have an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a cook, someone who knows how to fix a car or a tractor?\nOr for that matter, a certified accountant or an investment banker?\nIf you insist on having people with degrees, maybe a degree in agriculture would be a good fit for a big monastic foundation with a lot of land like, say, Clear Creek or that new Carmelite place in Nebraska.\nI think this is the time we are going to have to start overcoming our class snobbery.\nYoung men with ambitions for the priesthood are going to have to tuck away employability and an independent financial foundation, in the same way people used to tuck money away against a rainy day.\nSimply put, they’ve got to stop being materially dependent on the hierarchy.\nThis vulnerability is a gun to their heads in this time.\nThe next kid who says anything to me about wanting to enter the diocesan priesthood, I’m going to ask, “How sound is your investment portfolio?” The next candidate for religious life, I’ll ask, “Great!\nWhat’s your trade?\nWhat do you have to fall back on?”\nI’m given to understand that some houses of the Congregation of the Oratory ask candidates to come with an independent income, which, given what we’re seeing elsewhere doesn’t sound like a bad idea.\nPerhaps Catholic financial advisors could be encouraged to set up a programme to teach young men how to create a sound financial footing with investments.\nMeanwhile, we must refocus our energy on the Faith itself, instead of the physical and even canonical structures that house it.\nThat monastery in Germany is lost.\nThose bishops want the property and they’ll get it.\nWhat the group of laymen should be doing, instead of petitioning that it be saved, is finding a place where the nuns can live their charism of religious life without episcopal harassment.\nBishops won’t protect and support good priests?\nThen it’s up to us.\nThe Vatican wants to force all religious congregations into the pants-wearing, Marxist anti-nun, LCWR pattern?\nWe’re not helpless.\nWe start buying convent buildings and start a fund to support the nun-refugees.\nOur goal must be preserving the precious treasure, the Deposit of the Faith, the sacramental life, the great charisms and artifacts of the religious life.\nI am reminded of what the curators of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg did in the face of the advancing German army.\nThey took down, packed up and hid the art treasures, some of the greatest in the world.\nOver a million precious works of art were sent on trains to be hidden in the Urals.\nTwo trains got away to safety, but one was still there when the Germans surrounded the city and began the siege.\nThe museum’s website tells us:\n“Despite starvation and severely cold temperatures, the Museum continued its preservational functions.\nWith only a skeleton staff left behind, it was difficult to protect the vast buildings and their sumptuous interiors against snow, wind and rain.\nEquipped with first-aid kits, wearing helmets and gloves, the Museum air wardens cleared away heaps of broken bricks and the remains of charred flooring after each bomb hit the building; they helped dig out the living and the dead and bandage the wounded after raids in the surrounding area.\nTwelve air-raid shelters were fitted out in the basements of the Museum complex and until the first evacuations were made in March 1942 there were 12,000 people housed there permanently, among them the Museum Director, celebrated Academician Iosif Orbeli.” “Hermitage staff both in Sverdlovsk and in Leningrad acted as museum attendants, continuing their scholarly activity and lecturing in hospitals, holding conferences, writing scholarly articles.\nNo items were lost during the evacuation.”\nTo keep up everyone’s morale, the museum staff, while bombs were falling and they and their patrons were equally starving, continued to give tours and lectures, describing perfectly the artworks that had been removed.\nThey understood the value of what they had, and did everything within their power to preserve and protect it.\nDoes this all sound a bit, well, schismatic?\nNot necessarily.\nAny bishop who can demonstrate through his actions and not just with his tweets, who can prove that he is still a Catholic and not a wolf, is welcome to join us.\nBut we’d be fools to wait for them.\nWhatever you might think of Archbishop Lefebvre’s solution over the last few decades, it certainly seems inarguable that the “state of emergency” for which he was preparing has come at last.\nAnd in a state of emergency, certain norms are naturally suspended.\nThe simple fact is that soon there are going to be “vagus” priests who have been thrown out of their ministry for maintaining the Faith.\nThere are going to be nuns and monks without homes, as in the England of Henry VIII.\nI think it’s only reasonable that those who also want to maintain the Faith should reach out to them and offer what shelter we can.\nWhat we have seen this week is making it clear that we can simply no longer sit back and “beg” bishops to maintain and defend the Faith.\nIt’s not enough now to go into seminary or a monastery with glowing eyes and a firm faith.\nSentiment isn’t going to be much comfort when the young man is no longer so very young and finds himself standing on the street outside the chancery with no skills, no money, no job, (no health insurance) and no prospects.\nIf it is true that we really are alone in this, then so be it.\nLet’s stop lamenting and start doing practical things about it.\n___________________________________\n[1] Dreher and others are asking some very important questions now about the activities of the men McCarrick is known to have mentored, one of whom is currently making interesting headlines as Pope Francis’ Cardinal Prefect of the new Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life, and as the primary organiser of the upcoming World Meeting of Families in his native Dublin.\nIt should probably be noted that up to the time he left over a “difference of opinion” with the group’s leadership, Cardinal Kevin Farrell as also deeply involved in the Legionaries of Christ.\nHe joined in 1966, was ordained in ’78, and was quickly appointed to a high-ranking position as general director with responsibility for seminaries and schools of the Legionaries of Christ in Italy, Spain and Ireland until 1983.\nThis period was at the peak of the power of the grotesquely corrupt Fr.\nMaciel, for whom it has been shown ALL the Legion’s leadership was covering.\nThe Farrell family’s involvement in the Legion continues with his brother, Bishop Brian Farrell, who ordained 20 new priests to the questionable-but-officially-reformed community in 2015.\nA recent post to the official Regnum Christi website shows that Cardinal Kevin is still close enough to the Legion-related “lay” organisation to hire dicastery staff from their ranks.\nAfter he left the Legion, Kevin Farrell joined the diocesan clergy in Washington DC and became a protégé of the archbishop, Cardinal Wuerl.\nSo close is he to McCarrick that Farrell’s coat of arms, as Elizabeth Yore reported in these pages, is not much more than a tribute to his belatedly-disgraced mentor.\nSo, someone in a journalistic capacity might want to be asking a few questions about these things too.\n[2] It should also be noted that in his book, The Dictator Pope, historian Henry Sire documented that this is how Jorge Bergoglio has always operated, collecting bad men around him and controlling them with a masterful combination of threats and rewards.\nThe natural question, “Why does Pope Francis keep such bad men around him?” is now easy to answer.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Why Louis Farrakhan Is Back in the News\n\nLouis Farrakhan, the 84-year-old head of the Nation of Islam, has been back in the headlines after a previously unreleased photo of him with President Barack Obama was published in January and Mr. Farrakhan gave an anti-Semitic speech at his organization’s annual convention last month.\n\nThe Feb. 25 speech, which was given at an event for Saviour’s Day, a religious gathering of the Nation, ran for almost three hours.\nDuring it, Mr. Farrakhan said that the “powerful Jews” were his enemies, and that Jews were “responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out turning men into women and women into men,” as well as other incendiary remarks.\n\nA religious fundamentalist whose group has been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Mr. Farrakhan is fervently opposed to the legitimacy of the state of Israel, and his political positions regarding the country frequently spill over into bigoted remarks about Jews, which is why many public officials have avoided association with him.\nMr. Farrakhan has denied that he is anti-Semitic and has even said that his father may have been Jewish.\n\nMuch of the recent coverage has been focused on Tamika Mallory, one of the heads of the Women’s March organization, who attended the Feb. 25 speech, and on Representative Danny Davis, a Democrat of Illinois, who defended Mr. Obama and Mr. Farrakhan after the photo came to light.\nTheir reluctance to condemn Mr. Farrakhan has led to criticism from across the ideological spectrum this week.\n\nWhat is the Nation of Islam?\nThe Nation of Islam is a political and religious movement that was started by W.D.\nFard Muhammad in 1931 and continued by Elijah Muhammad in 1933.\nIt first became prominent after a man named Malcolm Little joined the organization.\nEncouraged by Elijah Muhammad, he changed his last name to X and became a minister in the movement.\n\nEdward E. Curtis IV, the author of “Black Muslim Religion in the Nation of Islam,” said that while estimates ranged wildly about how many bona fide members belonged to the Nation, he believes that there were tens of thousands of members in the 1960s and early 1970s.\nBut he said that millions of others sympathized with the movement’s anticolonial stance and were inspired by its most famous member, Muhammad Ali.\n\nWho is Louis Farrakhan?\nBorn Louis Eugene Walcott in New York in 1933, Mr. Farrakhan joined the Nation of Islam in the mid-1950s and rose quickly within the organization, becoming close to Malcolm X.\nAfter the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, he became one of the most powerful members of the Nation and its chief spokesman, the position that Malcolm X had held.\n\nThe Nation of Islam had gained followers around the nation in the 1940s and ’50s by providing something of a religious answer to antiblack racism.\nIt was not widely recognized as an anti-Jewish organization during its early years (its early literature, though, focused on “the white man” as “the white devil”).\nBut in 1967, it became outspokenly and flagrantly anti-Zionist, in an expression of solidarity with Palestinians.\nThat political position became a vehicle for Mr. Farrakhan to express his anti-Semitism.\n(Among his more infamous comments is his 1984 description of Adolf Hitler as “a very great man.”)\n\nIn 1975, when Elijah Muhammad died, the Nation split into two factions.\nThe faction reconstituted under Mr. Farrakhan in the late 1970s retained the original name, though not the influence or support that it had when its leaders were Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali and Elijah Muhammad.\nMr. Curtis said that today the membership could be in the thousands, and there could even be as many as 10,000 followers.\nMr. Farrakhan, whose name, the Anti-Defamation League wrote after the February event, is “virtually synonymous with anti-Semitism,” then drew national attention in 1984, when he exhorted his followers to support Jesse Jackson’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nIn a radio address, he urged listeners to “make an example” of a Washington Post reporter who had reported that Mr. Jackson had used anti-Semitic terms in private.\nMr. Jackson repudiated Mr. Farrakhan, but the minister’s support proved troublesome to his 1988 campaign as well.\n\nHe was back in the news in 1995 when he organized what became known as the “Million Man March,” a political and religious revival event in Washington.\n\nWhy were Tamika Mallory and Danny Davis reluctant to denounce him?\nMs. Mallory, who declined to comment for this article, did not respond to calls to condemn Mr. Farrakhan, for whom she had expressed admiration in the past.\n\nOn March 3, she said on Twitter that someone had brought to her attention that she had yet to tweet “my absolute position on how wrong anti-Semitism is.” A day later, she said that she was “committed to ending anti-black racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia & transphobia,” but did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\n\nIn an essay posted Wednesday, she said that she had been attending Saviour’s Day celebrations for over 30 years.\n\n“In that most difficult period of my life, it was the women of the Nation of Islam who supported me and I have always held them close to my heart for that reason,” she said.\nThe essay did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\nAsked what the appeal of Mr. Farrakhan’s views might be to people like Ms. Mallory, religious scholars emphasized that the Nation of Islam is a religion and can provide comfort and aid to its adherents.\n\n“For those who find it appealing, it is a form of radical black self love that is willing to challenge any potential impediment to black freedom,” Mr. Curtis said.\n\nYvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore who called Mr. Farrakhan’s remarks about Jews “unbelievably vile,” emphasized that his fundamentalism was comparable to the fundamentalist views found in other religions.\n\nCoincidentally, the photo of Mr. Farrakhan and Mr. Obama had been published by the Trice Edney News Wire in January.\nThe News Wire reported that the picture had been taken by the photojournalist Askia Muhammad during a 2005 meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus and that Mr. Muhammad kept the photo under wraps so as not to hurt Mr. Obama’s candidacy.\n\n(Mr. Muhammad, in a 2012 blog post, said that he was an admirer of Mr. Farrakhan and that the minister was not an anti-Semite.\nHe reaffirmed that he admired Mr. Farrakhan in an interview on Friday, though he said that the things the minister says about Jewish people “sometimes make me shudder.”)\n\nKatie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said on Friday: “President Obama has denounced racism and anti-Semitism his entire life.\nThat includes his public and repeated repudiations of Louis Farrakhan’s views over the years.\nToday is no different — he still rejects the harmful and divisive views Farrakhan continues to espouse.”\n\nRepresentative Davis, who was interviewed by The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, after the photo emerged, called Mr. Farrakhan an “outstanding human being,” and later said he was not bothered by the leader’s position on “The Jewish Question.”\n\nAfter a monthlong backlash about that interview, largely in conservative media, Mr. Davis said in a statement to Forward on Thursday that “I reject, condemn and oppose Minister Farrakhan’s views and remarks regarding the Jewish people and the Jewish religion.”\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Dallas Police Dept.\nfires officer who killed Botham Jean in his apartment\n\nThe Dallas Police Department fired Officer Amber Guyger on Monday, two weeks after she was charged in the fatal shooting of her neighbor.\nThis contradicted the police chief’s recent statements that she was unable to discipline the officer while a criminal investigation proceeded.\n\nGuyger allegedly walked into the apartment of the neighbor, Botham Jean, and fatally shot him Sept 6.\n\nWhen she was arrested three days later on manslaughter charges, Guyger said she confused Jean’s home for her own, confused Jean for an intruder, and shot him when he refused her commands, according to court documents.\nThe victim’s family has disputed her account and said she had knocked on Jean’s door before killing him.\n\nThe incident — one of more than 700 police killings counted by The Washington Post this year — sparked criticism against the police department, which waited days to arrest Guyger, then went weeks without disciplining her even though she was placed on leave.\n“The delay raised questions about why investigators held off on arresting the officer and about whether law enforcement authorities were showing deferential treatment for one of their own,” Kristine Phillips and Deanna Paul wrote for The Post.\n\nAfter repeated protests, Police Chief U. Reneé Hall gave contradictory explanations last week for why she could not fire the officer.\nShe told a town hall that “local, state and federal laws prohibit me from taking action,” according to ABC affiliate WFAA.\n\nTwo days later, the Dallas Morning News reported that police could fire Guyger but did not plan to review her employment until a criminal investigation wrapped up — probably months away.\nIn a statement, Hall said that any disciplinary investigation would risk compromising the criminal case.\n“That is not a risk I am willing to take,” she said.\n\nPolice did not explain what changed by Monday, when the department announced that an internal-affairs investigation had been launched and already “concluded” that Guyger’s arrest was a fireable offense.\nThe officer, who was hired in late 2013, was terminated during a hearing Monday morning “for her actions.”\n\nThe statement notes that Guyger can appeal her firing.\nPolice did not comment on whether Hall is still worried that the termination might affect the criminal investigation.\n\nAs Paul wrote for The Post, the more significant legal questions are whether Guyger is prosecuted as a police officer or civilian and whether a jury decides she acted reasonably in using deadly force.\n>","completion":" no propaganda found."}

{"prompt":"Leaked Doc Reveals White House Planning “Regime Change” In Iran\n\nThis report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge\nIt appears Rudy Giuliani wasn’t lying.\nJust a few days after the former NYC mayor and latest member of President Trump’s unexpectedly let it slip that “we got a president who is tough, who does not listen to the people who are naysayers, and a president who is committed to regime change [in Iran]”, the Washington Free Beacon has obtained a three-page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials with drafted plans to spark regime change in Iran, following the US exit from the Obama-era nuclear deal and the re-imposition of tough sanctions aimed at toppling the Iranian regime.\nThe plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including – who else – National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009, writes the Free Beacon, which obtained a leaked copy of the circulating plans.\nThe regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton—a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change—entered the White House.\nIt deemphasizes U.S military intervention, instead focusing on a series of moves to embolden an Iranian population that has increasingly grown angry at the ruling regime for its heavy investments in military adventurism across the region.\n–Free Beacon\n“The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation, while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command,” SSG writes in the paper.\n“This has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months” it further claims as an argument to push a “regime change” policy.\nFor now – at least – overthrowing the Iran government, with its extensive and close ties to the Kremlin, is not official US policy; SSG president Jim Hanson told the Free Beacon that the Trump administration does not want to engage in direct military intervention in Iran – and is instead focusing on other methods of ridding Iran of its “hardline ruling regime.”\n“The Trump administration has no desire to roll tanks in an effort to directly topple the Iranian regime,” Hanson said.\n“But they would be much happier dealing with a post-Mullah government.\nThat is the most likely path to a nuclear weapons-free and less dangerous Iran.”\nThat will likely change, however.\nOne source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, solidified the Iranian regime’s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change\n“The JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the Islamic Republic,” said the source, who would only speak to the Free Beacon on background about the sensitive issue.\n“Prior to that, everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism.\nIt’s now Trump, Bolton, and [Mike] Pompeo’s job to put this consensus back in place.”\nThe source tells the Beacon that Bolton is “acutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region.”\n“John is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally, and knows that you’re never going to fundamentally change its behavior—and the threats against Israel and the Saudis especially—until that revolutionary regime is gone,” the source said, adding that “nothing’s off the table right now if Israel is attacked.”\nThat said, Bolton is confident that an Iranian regime change will occur in the next six months:\nJohn Bolton – We Will Be Celebrating in Tehran Before 2019 >You can’t say you weren’t warned pic.twitter.com\/F1dvZAVQaF — Battle Beagle 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 (@HarmlessYardDog) May 7, 2018\nA second source tells The Beacon that the Trump administration recognizes that the “chief impediment to the region is Iran’s tyrannical regime.”\n“The problem is not the Iran nuclear deal it’s the Iranian regime,” said the source.\n“Team Bolton has spent years creating Plans B, C, and D for dealing with that problem.\nPresident Trump hired him knowing all of that.\nThe administration will now start aggressively moving to deal with the root cause of chaos and violence in the region in a clear-eyed way.”\nRegional sources who have spoken to SSG “tell us that Iranian social media is more outraged about internal oppression, such as the recent restrictions on Telegram, than about supporting or opposing the nuclear program.\nIranian regime oppression of its ethnic and religious minorities has created the conditions for an effective campaign designed to splinter the Iranian state into component parts,” the group states.\n–Free Beacon\n“More than one third of Iran’s population is minority groups, many of whom already seek independence,” the paper explains.\n“U.S.\nsupport for these independence movements, both overt and covert, could force the regime to focus attention on them and limit its ability to conduct other malign activities.”\nWithout a regime change, the United States will continue face threats from Iranian forces stationed throughout the region, including in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon.\n“The probability the current Iranian theocracy will stop its nuclear program willingly or even under significant pressure is low,” the plan states.\n“Absent a change in government within Iran, America will face a choice between accepting a nuclear-armed Iran or acting to destroy as much of this capability as possible.”\nThat said, President Trump made clear earlier in the week that US officials must make efforts to differentiate between the people of Iran and its ruling regime.\n“Any public discussion of these options, and any messaging about the Iranian regime in general, should make a bright line distinction between the theocratic regime along with its organs of oppression and the general populace,” according to the plan.\n“We must constantly reinforce our support for removing the iron sandal from the necks of the people to allow them the freedom they deserve.”\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|359|368\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|2778|2810\nLoaded_Language|4302|4319\nLoaded_Language|4575|4587\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|5775|5900."}

{"prompt":"Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert\n\nNewsCatholic Church\nWASHINGTON, D.C., February 12, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Those familiar with Jorge Bergoglio in Argentina before he became Pope Francis say it is a “classic” move of his to provide “mercy” to clergy who are sexual predators while asking everybody else to simply “move on,” said attorney and child advocate Elizabeth Yore on an EWTN show last week.\n“I think this is a misplaced mercy.\nIt is mercy for the predator priests,” she told EWTN’s Raymond Arroyo on the February 8 episode of World Over.\n“There are many people who know the Pope from Argentina who have said this is classic Bergoglio to provide mercy to the predators and ask everybody else to move on,” she added.\n(See original The World Over program segment on this issue that begins at 47 seconds into the video below)\nYore, who has handled child abuse investigations and clergy abuse investigations throughout her legal career, was commenting on the latest sexual abuse case to touch the Francis papacy, in this case where the Pope appointed a bishop with a history of complicity in child sex abuse.\nThe Pope’s claim that he had never received any victim testimony regarding the complicity of Chilean Bishop Juan Barros in child sex abuse has proven to be false.\n“The Barros case is putting the Pope, for the first time, in the middle as a principal in a cover-up,” Yore said during the interview.\nYore said that not only is it now known that the Pope received a letter from one of the victims, but it is also now known that he was “told from the moment he appointed Bishop Barros in 2015 that this was a bad decision.”\n“The Chilean Archbishop conference told him to revoke this appointment.\nHe received petitions and letters and calls, yet, ignored them all,” she said.\nAs details continue to surface, the pontiff’s professed empathy for abuse victims has come into question as well.\nYore called the child sex abuse case involving infamous Chilean priest abuser Father Fernando Karadima and Bishop Juan Barros “a scandal of epic proportions.”\nThe scandal signals that the Church under Francis is slipping backwards in its handling of abuse, said Yore.\nYore called the example Pope Francis set in the way he handled the abuse information “extremely dangerous.”\n“But it is extremely dangerous as the head of the Catholic Church — you know, the last appeal — that this is the kind of behavior that is going to be mimicked around the world by bishops, [who will say] ‘Well if the Pope is not going to intervene and impose zero tolerance, why should I?’”\nReports say Pope Francis personally received the eight-page letter from the Chilean victim graphically detailing the alleged abuses by Karadima and linking Barros as having witnessed and covered up the abuse.\nThe alleged abuse took place decades prior to Francis’s 2015 appointment of Barros to the Diocese of Osorno in southern Chile.\nPope Francis received the victim’s letter in 2015, its author and a member of Francis’s sex abuse commission have said, contradicting the Pope’s recent insistence that no victims had come forward in the matter and no evidence had been produced.\nFrancis encountered protests in Chile over his defense of Barros during his visit there last month, calling the accusations against the priest “calumny.”\nWhile Francis later apologized, he persisted in defending Barros, denying that he had received any testimony himself and restating that such unproven accusations are “slander.”\nThe Pope later said he would send Malta Archbishop Charles Scicluna – the former top Vatican abuse investigator - to Chile to investigate the matter.\nExpectations were high in 2014 when the Pope created the abuse commission.\nAnd while he has continually condemned clergy sex abuse throughout his pontificate, some have argued his actions in some serious cases don’t match his tough stances on abuse.\nFour members of the commission had met with Cardinal O’Malley in 2015, conveying their objections to Francis’s 2015 appointment of Barros as bishop of Osorno.\nIt was at the meeting with O’Malley that the abuse commission representatives reportedly gave the letter to the cardinal to deliver to Francis, and O’Malley later confirmed to a commission member that he had in fact personally delivered the letter to the Pope.\nYore explained that the Pope has been told from the moment he appointed Barros in 2015 that it was a bad decision, between the Chilean bishops’ conference, petitions, letters and calls, that were all ignored.\nFurther, a Chilean judicial inquiry found all the victims who testified — including the letter’s author Juan Carlos — to be credible, and that there was a major cover-up of the abuse by Father Karadima.\nArroyo spoke with Cruz as well, who said he was “incredibly frustrated” when Barros was going to be appointed.\nHe’d testified about three bishops who had witnessed abuse, he said, but Barros had special significance for him because Barros’ part went beyond witnessing the abuse, to violating his seal of Confession with Karadima and psychological abuse through intimidation.\nCruz recounted how he and other victims had been dismissed or slandered by local Church hierarchy for numerous attempts to be heard.\nAnd he spoke about holding out hope that there would be a different response from the Pope, discussing specifics of getting the letter to the Francis via Cardinal O’Malley.\nCruz told Arroyo he was really hurt and felt betrayed by the Pope’s comments that the accusations were slander, and there were no witnesses or evidence.\n“To hear him talk about us that way,” Cruz said, “calling us slanderers, it was terrible because it set the clock back for so many victims.”\nScicluna will be meeting with Cruz, who said he hopes other abuse survivors will be heard as a result of his case coming more to the forefront.\n“This leaves us with very strong evidence that the Pope was, in fact, aware of what has happened,” Yore said.\n“Here we have victims 10, 15 years after their abuse, begging the Pope, having to take pictures of a letter that’s handed to a cardinal to ensure that there is evidence that the Pope is receiving this information.”\nThe whole of Latin America, including Argentina, was well aware of what was happening when this case broke in Chile in 2010, Yore noted, and yet the Pope continues to shrug his shoulders and say he has no information.\nThis was precisely what he’d been saying when he was cardinal and archbishop in Buenos Aires, she said, that no one ever came forward with information, and there were never any cases of clerical abuse in the entirety of the two-million-plus member Archdiocese of Buenos Aires.\n“This isn’t just simply a cover-up of a predator priest,” Yore stated.\n“This is Barros present, in the room when the abuse is ongoing with these young minor boys.”\nShe said she would argue as a child advocate that Barros was involved in sexual exploitation of children.\n“So I don’t think this is simply just a case, as bad as it is, of a cover-up of an abuser,” she said.\n“This is also sexual exploitation of children in a grooming gang, a predator priest.\nThis is why it is so heinous.”\nYore said that given the Church’s sex abuse crisis, one would have thought going into the 2013 conclave (which elected Francis) that an obvious priority in vetting candidates for the papacy would have meant a serious look at their history of handling abuse allegations in their previous sees.\nThere are more cases out there just like Barros that have been covered up, Yore told Arroyo, maybe even some even worse than the Barros case.\n“Those cases are going to be haunting this papacy and really causing a rift in the major protection of children that Pope Benedict had worked very hard to really build up,” she said.\n“Trust within the faithful and to put in a system that was going to root out the predators.\nAnd I think that has just been blown up and I think we are back to square one in the Vatican.\"\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Hundreds of Priests Accused in Pennsylvania, Church of Accompaniment in Crisis\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday released a sweeping grand jury report on sex abuse in the Catholic Church, listing hundreds of accused clergy and detailing 70 years of misconduct and church response across the state.\n\nThe release is the culmination of an 18-month probe, led by state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, on six of the state’s eight dioceses — Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Allentown, Scranton, Erie and Greensburg — and follows other state grand jury reports that revealed abuse and coverups in two other dioceses.\n\nSome details and names that might reveal the 300 clergy listed have been redacted from the report.\nLegal challenges by clergy delayed the report’s release, after some said it is a violation of their constitutional rights.\nPennsylvania’s Supreme Court ruled last month that the report must be released but with some redaction.\n\nThe report’s release begins an information war, with prosecutors and many victims saying it’s the start of holding church leaders at the top accountable for the first time, while church lawyers and other advocates for the institution say the report depicts an era of another century, unfairly smearing today’s Catholicism in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe report has helped renew a crisis many in the church thought and hoped had ended nearly 20 years ago after the scandal erupted in Boston.\nBut recent abuse-related scandals, from Chile to Australia, have reopened wounding questions about accountability and whether church officials are still covering up crimes at the highest levels.\n\nThe new wave of allegations has called Pope Francis’s handling of abuse into question as many Catholics look to him to help the church regain its credibility.\nThe pope’s track record has been mixed, something some outsiders attribute to his learning curve or shortcomings and others chalk up to resistance from a notoriously change-averse institution.\n\nThe Pennsylvania grand jury report follows the resignation last month of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, a towering figure in the U.S. church and former D.C. archbishop who was accused of sexually abusing minors and adults for decades.\nBoth have further polarized the church on homosexuality, celibacy and whether laypeople should have more power.\nIt has also triggered debate about whether statutes of limitations should be expanded.\n\n“We’re dealing with a long-term struggle not only about the meaning of justice, but about the meaning of memory,” said Jason Berry, a reporter and author who has covered the sexual abuse crisis for decades.\n“And how honest the church has been about this crisis.\nMost bishops, besides apologies, have not been on the cutting edge of change.”\n\nChurch officials began bracing for the aftermath of the report.\nOn Monday, D.C.’s archbishop, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, former longtime leader of the Pittsburgh diocese, warned his priests in a letter that the probe will be “profoundly disturbing.”\nREMNANT COMMENT: The report also shows that “more than 90 ‘offenders’ will be listed” in Donald Cardinal Wuerl’s former diocese, which is ironic since Wuerl is one of Pope Francis’s closest U.S. advisers and sits on the Vatican’s bishop oversight committee.\nWell played, Cardinal Wuerl!\nSo, let me get this straight (I know, lots of luck with that one): These are the people that are going to \"accompany us\" and our children in the \"synodal Church\" with its new orientation, overseen by a \"God of Surprises\" who is uber-merciful and doesn't judge, and headed up by a pope who, according to Father Thomas Rosica, \"breaks Catholic traditions whenever he wants, because he is 'free from disordered attachments'?''\nYou don't say!\nAll this and rampant homosexuality in the priesthood, too... along with a \"trivialized liturgy\" (according to Pope Benedict XVI) and widespread apostasy among the faithful?\nRemind me again: What exactly has Vatican II and the last fifty years of aggiornamento given us?\nBecause I can't seem to think of a darn thing, apart from heretical homilies, sodomitical clergy and an increasingly lavender liturgy.\nYou know what, guys?\nThanks, but no thanks.\nYou can take your 'Church of Accompaniment\" to prison with you.\nI'd sooner let my kids be accompanied by fans of the Oakland Raiders than turn them over to you... meaning no disrespect to fans of the Oakland Raiders, of course.\n#stopthesynod\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event\n\nDaniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism.\nThe American Jewish Historical Society was founded to study and preserve Jewish history.\nThese days it’s instead partnering with Jewish Voice for Peace: an anti-Israel BDS hate group that defends anti-Semitism and which sponsored talks by an anti-Semite who accused Jews of drinking blood.\nThe fruits of the AJHS and JVP partnership have been a series of events attacking Israel.\nComing up in late October is “The Balfour Declaration: Support for a Jewish Homeland or Jewish State?”\nThe two speakers are Robert Herbst, the coordinator of the Westchester chapter of JVP, and Jonathan Kuttab, who advocates a one-state solution for eliminating Israel.\nHe had tweeted, \"EU no longer considers #Hamas a terrorist group.\nTime for US to do same.\"\nKuttab has defended Islamic anti-Semitism by claiming that the “distrust Moslems feel towards Jews” is due to “two acts of betrayal by Jewish tribes against the Prophet.” And that Jews suffer from a “Holocaust Syndrome” of entitlement.\nHe justified hijacking planes, described suicide bombers as “taking the supreme sacrifice” and defended Hezbollah as “an armed-resistance movement”\nHe has claimed that the \"Jewish community gradually consolidated its power, wealth, and influence in all sectors of society\" especially in \"crucial sectors like banking, finance, media” where \"their influence both as individuals and an organized community far exceeded their numbers\" and that their power strengthens “conspiracy theories about ‘Jewish control’ that are reminiscent of the infamous “’Protocols of the Elders of Zion.’”\nRobert Herbst and Jonathan Kuttab are both supporters of a one-state plan for eliminating Israel.\nThe American Jewish Historical Society is co-sponsoring a JVP anti-Israel event by two opponents of Israel, one of whom has defended Hamas.\nAn organization that hands out the Emma Lazarus Award, named after a passionate Zionist, at its posh dinners is hosting attacks on the existence of Israel.\nThe “Jewish Homeland” or “Jewish State” argument is a hook for contending that the Balfour Declaration didn’t endorse Israel, but some sort of Jewish Bantustan within a Muslim country.\nThat worked so well for the Christians and Jews of the Middle East.\nThe American Jewish Historical Society is not only co-sponsoring a one-state event by an anti-Israel hate group.\nBut it’s also hosting it at the Center for Jewish History’s headquarters.\nAJHS is a component of the Center for Jewish History.\nAnd the partnership between AJHS and JVP sheds light on the controversy over the appointment of David N. Myers, an anti-Israel activist, to head the Center for Jewish History.\nDuring the Myers controversy, the Center took pains to disassociate Myers and themselves from JVP because a JVP handout had listed him as a “JVP Academic Advisory Board Member.” But in reality the Center, through AJHS, has an ongoing relationship with JVP.\nThe Balfour event was not AJHS’ only partnership with JVP.\nIn December, the AJHS will feature “Rubble Rubble”, a play by Dan Fishback based on his trip to Israel.\nFishback is a BDS supporter and a member of the JVP Artists Council.\nHis goal is to “normalize Jewish anti-Zionism”.\nAJHS and JVP members get discounted admission.\nThe venue is once again the Center for Jewish History.\nSpecifically the Leo and Julia Forchheimer Auditorium at CJH.\nLeo Forchheimer’s philanthropy had left its mark on Israel.\nWhat would he think if he knew the anti-Israel purposes that CJH is putting his gift to?\nA third AJHS-JVP event featured Efrat Yerday, an anti-Israel activist, accusing Israel of racism.\nEfrat has claimed that, \"Zionism does not only dispossess Palestinians, but it also dispossesses in a very sophisticated way, non-white Jews.\nBeing Jewish is highly identified with being white because of Zionism.\"\nAJHS will claim that it is only offering different perspectives.\nBut when it comes to Israel, there’s only one perspective.\n“Balfour” and “Rubble Rubble” are to be part of AJHS’ “1917: How One Year Changed the World”.\nThe exhibition is supposed to cover WWI, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the Balfour Declaration.\nBut the only Balfour program on the list questions whether Israel should even exist.\nThe exhibition closes with Fishback’s anti-Israel agenda.\nAnd these are the only listed AJHS programs that focus on Israel.\nJVP is also the only organization that AJHS chooses to partner with on political events.\nThe American Jewish Historical Society appears to be uninterested in holding any pro-Israel events.\nIt’s uninterested in partnering with pro-Israel groups.\nInstead it’s providing a forum for a BDS hate group.\nAnd it’s no mystery why.\nThe AJHS Academic Council is packed with anti-Israel activists.\nLila Corwin-Berman, the chair of the AJHS Academic Council who also serves on its board of trustees, is a member of the Open Hillel Academic Council.\nOpen Hillel seeks to \"open\" the campus group to BDS and other anti-Israel views.\nBerman has defended the anti-Israel hate group IfNotNow, which employs JVP tactics, and condemned efforts to fight BDS.\nShe signed a petition in support of BDS activists being allowed to enter Israel.\nOther AJHS Academic Council members who signed the pro-BDS activist petition include Ari Kelman, Riv-Ellen Prell, Deborah Dash Moore, Rachel Kranson, Libby Garland and Kirsten Fermaglich.\nWhen we look at what is going on in CJH’s components like the AJHS, the elevation of David N. Myers to head CJH is unsurprising.\nMyers is a symptom of the problem.\nAs is AJHS’s partnership with JVP.\nA great deal of shocking behavior is taking place inside Jewish organizations whose inner workings most people in the Jewish community generally pay very little attention to.\nUnlike CJH, the American Jewish Historical Society is an organization that dates back to the 19th century.\nIts perversion by the radical anti-Jewish and anti-Israel left to serve anti-Semitic narratives is tragic.\nAnd yet it’s inescapable.\nEven as the Myers scandal continues to simmer, the AJHS partnership with JVP is making the choice painfully clear.\nThe radical anti-Israel left will not be satisfied with embedding “moderate” opposing voices into Jewish organizations.\nInstead it seeks to normalize the furthest extremes of anti-Israel hatred.\nAnd it will not be satisfied with anything less.\nDuring the Myers controversy, defenders of his appointment, including some figures named here, claimed that it was an issue of apolitical scholarship.\nIs co-sponsoring events with a hate group that has sponsored talks by a woman who accused Jews of drinking blood also apolitical scholarship?\nThe anti-Israel leftists at the AJHS are clearly not leaving their politics at home.\nAnd support for them and for Myers cannot be distinguished from support for their views.\nNot when JVP is at AJHS.\nWe all have choices to make.\nSometimes the choices are murky.\nOther times they are simple and easy.\nWhen the American Jewish Historical Society hosts and co-sponsors an event by a BDS hate group attacking the existence of Israel and featuring a speaker who had defended terrorism and anti-Semitism, the choice becomes easy.\nEither you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews.\nAs the anti-Israel radicalism of the left grows, such choices will become even more obscenely simple.\nBut they will not be any less difficult.\nOpposing the anti-Israel left makes many important enemies and wins few friends.\nThe anti-Israel left has built networks that can blacklist, smear and silence almost anyone in an academic field.\nSpeaking out against hate is easiest when it’s weakest.\nIt’s hardest when it’s strongest.\nWhen we think about Nazi Germany, we remember those who spoke out.\nWe don’t remember those who were too intimidated and uncertain to rise against anti-Semitism when they saw it and heard it.\nHistory tells us why so many people are afraid to do the right thing when it counts.\nIt also tells us how irrelevant history makes them.\nThere are lessons here for the Center for Jewish History and the American Jewish Historical Society, for those on the inside who see the corruption of their organizations every day and for those on the outside who are worried about speaking up.\nThere are lessons here for all of us.\nIf you can’t speak out against the American Jewish Historical Society’s partnership with a hate group linked to a literal blood libels and a speaker who defends Hamas, when will your voice be heard?\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|388|414\nLoaded_Language|490|520\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|899|972\nLoaded_Language|1173|1207\nName_Calling,Labeling|1313|1356\nRepetition|3752|3766\nLoaded_Language|6029|6043\nLoaded_Language|6754|6784\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|7337|7433\nFlag-Waving|3829|4015\nLoaded_Language|6201|6207\nThought-terminating_Cliches|7013|7040\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|7337|7433."}

{"prompt":"Brett Kavanaugh accused in letter obtained by FBI of drunkenly forcing himself on woman while in high school; Kavanaugh denies it happened\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, held a woman down, covered her mouth and tried to force himself on her while drunk at a party in high school.\nThat’s the nexus of a letter allegedly acquired by Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein in July but dropped on the last days before the vote for Kavanaugh’s confirmation.\nThe unidentified woman says the incident took place at a party in the early 1980s while Kavanaugh was a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda, Md., according to the NYDN, which claims to have obtained the letter on Friday.\nShe alleges Kavanaugh and a friend of his, both of whom had been drinking, cornered her in a room and turned up the music to blur out the sound of her protests.\nKavanaugh then allegedly covered the woman’s mouth with his hand and attempted to force himself on her, but she says she managed to free herself and bolt out of the room.\nKavanaugh, 53, vehemently denied the woman’s allegations.\n“I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,” he said in a statement.\n“I did not do this back in high school or at any time.”\nKavanaugh’s friend, who has not been identified, did not outright deny the woman’s claims but told the New Yorker he has “no recollection of that.”\nThe woman says she has had to undergo psychological treatment as a result of the incident.\nShe first approached her congresswoman, Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., about the allegations in July shortly after Trump tapped Kavanaugh to replace outgoing Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.\nEshoo’s office declined to comment.\nThe woman’s letter was in turn forwarded to Feinstein, D-Calif., who shared it with the FBI and her Democratic committee colleagues on Wednesday night.\nAn FBI official told the New York Daily News on Thursday that the letter has not yet resulted in a criminal investigation.\nAccording to Breitbart, on Friday, 65 women from both the Republican and Democrat parties who have known Kavanaugh since high school defended his character and said he has always behaved “honorably” and treaded “women with respect.”\nThe women also said that Kavanaugh has “stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity.”\n“Judge Kavanaugh has denied this allegation and over 60 women – with a broad range of political views – who’ve known him since high school, have sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee vouching for his integrity and respect for women over that time,” says Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network.\n“This is nothing more than a last-minute attempt at character assassination, and there should no delay in confirming Judge Kavanaugh.”\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|1150|1204\nSlogans|2735|2758\nLoaded_Language|1106|1123\nAppeal_to_Authority|2684|2815."}
{"prompt":"Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face\n\nThe president is doubling down on an increasingly risky candidate.\nJustice Anthony Kennedy gave President Donald Trump the biggest political gift possible when he announced his resignation in the spring.\nEven though not everything that’s gone wrong is Trump’s fault, he has managed to make a complete hash of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to fill the empty seat on the court.\nIt’s a good example of how badly Trump does his job more than a year and a half into his administration.\n\nTo begin with, Trump has outsourced his judicial nominations to outside, party-aligned groups, the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society.\nThat included an unusually central role for the Federalist Society’s Leonard Leo.\n\nThat wasn’t entirely a Trump mistake.\nHis decision during the campaign to release a list of potential justices drafted by Leo reflected the reality-TV star’s weakness as a presidential candidate.\nThe party was worried that Trump might turn out not to be a conservative; to reassure them, he publicly committed to their top goal.\nIn some ways, that’s successful coalition-building, and what he’s done in office is just keeping his promises on judges.\n\nStill, it’s one thing to form an alliance with conservatives; it’s another to turn the whole process over to them.\nWe don’t know to what extent Kavanaugh was Trump’s choice and to what extent he was manipulated into choosing him.\nWe have plenty of evidence that Trump is easily manipulated by those around him, and that Kavanaugh is a good fit for Trump’s biases: The judge has Ivy League credentials and he passes Trump’s cut-of-his-jib test by looking the part.\n1\n\nEither way, Kavanaugh was a poor choice from the point of view of good presidenting.\nThe judge was certain to be a highly controversial selection from the start.\nAfter all, he had been a highly controversial selection for his current circuit court seat, eventually getting confirmed with only four Democratic votes after a long delay.\nKavanaugh is a longtime Republican operative, a hard-liner during both the Vince Foster and Monica Lewinsky investigations.\nNominating him, rather than a conservative with similar views but a different background, was bound to stir up trouble.\nIt was also true, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly warned, that normal disclosure of Kavanaugh’s record, especially his service during the George W. Bush administration, was going to delay confirmation even more.\nSenate Republicans dealt with that problem by deciding to not bother with any Kavanaugh documents that couldn’t be produced rapidly, which further riled up the Democrats and gave that party some good talking points.\n2\n\n\nSometimes it’s worth taking risks.\nPresidents who shy away from anything that’s not a sure thing can fail to exploit opportunities.\nIt’s just very hard to see any upside for Trump in choosing Kavanaugh instead of a safer, but still very conservative, other option.\n3\n\nWhen serious charges of sexual misconduct were raised against Kavanaugh, Trump decided to stick with him instead of moving on to another candidate.\nIt’s still not clear that Kavanaugh’s nomination is doomed, but it’s certainly in severe trouble.\nLosing a high-profile fight is always going to hurt a president, which is why they should take care to avoid high-risk, low-reward conflicts.\nBut there’s an art to minimizing damage.\nAnd Trump hasn’t learned it yet.\n\nFor one thing, the president has made this an extremely high-profile episode by stringing out the process as the accusations against Kavanaugh gained credibility and even multiplied.\nWhether that matters in terms of public opinion for Trump is unclear, but it certainly isn’t good for any Republican senators caught up in the middle, along with any other candidates who have had to weigh in only to find the facts as they knew them constantly changing.\n\nIt’s also the case that the more negative information comes out, the more it appears that the Trump and his White House staff failed to do their jobs in vetting and managing Kavanaugh.\nIf the nomination had been pulled right after Christine Blasey Ford made her initial assertions about Kavanaugh, the public might have concluded that it wasn’t Trump’s fault that a previously unaired accusation came to light.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s behavior has been as erratic as ever.\nFirst he said that Brasey had to be heard; then he attacked her in terms that were a slur on all women who have been assaulted without immediately reporting it to the police, and he also blamed the Senate for not voting before she came forward.\nHe sometimes praises Kavanaugh, but also let it be known that he thought the nominee had performed badly in his Fox News interview.\nThe White House demanded a final up and down vote on Tuesday; by Wednesday, he was saying that the nomination would die if Kavanaugh didn’t do well before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\nThe sum of all this has been, as in many other episodes, that Trump and his White House are a gang that can’t shoot straight and that he’s eager to blame his allies and lash out at his enemies in ugly ways when things go wrong.\n\nA botched nomination matters because allies will be less likely to trust Trump, not just on Supreme Court choices, but on any initiative.\nAnd, for that matter, they’ll be less likely to trust him when he asserts that there’s nothing remaining for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to reveal.\nTrump’s professional reputation is already terrible, but everything counts.\nAs the political scientist Richard Neustadt said, political elites are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating the president.\nTrump is hurting himself right now, and will have hurt himself more if Kavanaugh is not confirmed.\n\nAnd yes, I call it the cut-of-his-jib test quite deliberately.\nIt's no surprise that someone who hires based on what he thinks someone doing that job should look like, which seems to be based on hazy old-time Hollywood casting, would wind up with fewer women in his administration than any of his recent predecessors.\n\nI've argued that too much disclosure is required, and that Democrats (and any wavering Republicans) had more than enough information to make up their mind.\nI still think that's true.\nBut it did leave Republicans vulnerable to claims about transparency which were likely to be popular -- most people, and the entire press corps, love transparency -- and vulnerable to bombshells in the documentary record which hadn't been initially disclosed.\nIn the event, that's not what's causing the trouble, but still it's an example of Trump taking needless risks.\n\nSome have speculated that Kavanaugh would be especially likely to rule in Trump's favor if any cases stemming from the Robert Mueller investigation wind up at the high court.\nPerhaps.\nThere are plenty of other partisan, conservative judges, and plenty of conservative judges who lean towards an expansive view of presidential powers.\nAnd if Kavanaugh is really an outlier on that issue, then he won't be in the majority on any future decision anyway.\nSo, no, I don't think there's any good reason to think Kavanaugh would be especially helpful to Trump compared to others he could have selected.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|24|49\nExaggeration,Minimisation|170|205\nLoaded_Language|343|356\nDoubt|449|477\nDoubt|888|956\nName_Calling,Labeling|902|919\nDoubt|1475|1522\nLoaded_Language|1636|1655\nLoaded_Language|3210|3224\nDoubt|3413|3440\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3489|3519\nDoubt|3991|4046\nLoaded_Language|4449|4468\nName_Calling,Labeling|5027|5059\nLoaded_Language|5131|5140\nAppeal_to_Authority|5529|5653\nLoaded_Language|5778|5797\nCausal_Oversimplification|5840|5921\nLoaded_Language|5950|5981\nLoaded_Language|6441|6451\nName_Calling,Labeling|6839|6868."}

{"prompt":"Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders\n\nThe Francis Vatican’s approach to the contemplative life is probably the most illustrative of our entire crisis.\nContemplative life is aimed only at a purely supernatural end.\nIt has no “use” in the sense that either the Bergoglians – in terms of their political machinations – or the world can understand.\nThere is probably no other place where the differences between the two programmes - the Catholic programme of Christ and the Bergoglian\/Kasperian programme - are more sharply contrasted.\nOne aspect of Pope Francis’ character that seems little-explored by the Catholic and secular media alike is his apparent disdain for contemplative religious life – a facet of Catholic life that could be described as the most purely religious of all the Church’s undertakings.\nThe world does not understand it or want it.\nTherefore, it is something of a thorn in the Bergoglian side, and he has repeatedly expressed his contempt for it.\nSo when, in 2016 he issued a document on contemplative nuns, the faithful braced for impact .\nIn his recent document, ostensibly on holiness, “Gaudete et Exultate,” the pope attacked the religious desire for silence and solitude, to be alone with God in prayer, seeking unity with Him, saying in essence that the Christian life is inherently about social activism, about material, worldly ends.\nTo these foundations of the contemplative life – indeed of any form of religious life in the Church – Francis set up another of his false dichotomies, contemplation in opposition to serving others, giving a Jesuit maxim as an imperative for all Catholics: “We are called to be contemplatives even in the midst of action, and to grow in holiness by responsibly and generously carrying out our proper mission.”\nItalian Vaticanist Marco Tosatti commented dryly, “Rejoice and be glad… but not if you’re a cloistered contemplative.”\nIn 2016, I wrote that Francis’ Apostolic Constitution, “Vultum dei quaerere” was in some respects the most damaging object of the wrecking-ball pontificate to date.\nUnfortunately, it was about a subject that the world, and therefore the modern Church, cares so little about that hardly anyone noticed.\nAimed specifically at female contemplative religious, the document threatened that in a year or so another would be forthcoming laying out precisely what would now be required of nuns to continue in their vocations.\nThe new document issued last week, “Cor orans,” is juridical, that is, it is not much more than a list of specific norms, or rules – 289 of them!\n– that all communities of contemplative nuns must now follow.\nOne odd remark in article 19 is maybe the most succinct description of the direction planned for contemplatives:\n“A monastery of nuns, as every religious house, is erected while keeping in mind its usefulness for the Church and for the Institute.” (emphasis added)\nWait… its “usefulness”?\nI think a fair question for the Faithful to ask this Vatican department might be, “According to what specific criteria is a monastery’s ‘usefulness’ actually determined?”\nOne can’t help but hearken back to the criteria for monasteries that were allowed to survive the revolutionary purges in 18th and 19th century Europe.\nA house that could prove to the secularists that it was “useful” – that it could care for the indigent elderly, teach children or nurse the sick – would be allowed to continue.\nThose which were purely contemplative – a single-minded devotion to the adoration of God – were closed.\nIt is not an insignificant quirk of modern history, and one that tells us much about the nature of the current pontificate, that houses of contemplatives are always attacked by secularist regimes, from Henry VIII to the Soviet Union.\nRupture?\nWhat rupture?\nThe first thing Cor orans does is claim continuity with both pre and post-Vatican II theology.\nIn the Introduction, it seems anxious to establish a “hermeneutic of continuity” with Pius XII and his document Sponsa Christi Ecclesia of 1950.\nThe authors insist there is no contradiction between the two – except, of course, where there are contradictions – and that both Pius XII and Francis are keen to see nuns reaching the “aim of their specific vocation.” It describes Francis as promulgating this document “in the wake” of Pius XII[1].\nIn fact, Pope Francis, by promulgating the Apostolic Constitution Vultum Dei quaerere, on June 29, 2016, to help the contemplatives reach the aim of their specific vocation, invited reflection and discernment on the precise content tied to consecrated life in general and to the monastic tradition in particular, but he did not intend to abrogate Sponsa Christi Ecclesia that was derogated only in some points.\nAs a consequence, the two pontifical documents are to be held as normative in force for monasteries of nuns and must be read in a unitary vision.\nBut of course, the entire game is given away in the next paragraph:\nPope Francis, in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II, intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades, in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio-cultural conditions.\nYes, that’s what it said.\nHere’s my translation:\n“The Church’s ‘path’ of the last 50 years has been ‘fruitful’.\nHow do you know?\nBecause we’re telling you it has.”\nIn other words, there have been absolutely no problems whatever with the direction taken either by the Church or by the religious life since Vatican II.\nEverything that has happened has been in complete and perfect continuity between the Before Church and the After Church; there has been no rupture or break with the past.\nAll changes undertaken by religious houses were perfectly legitimate and good - “fruitful” if, perhaps, a bit “intense” – and have been made in “light of the teachings” of Vatican II and “changed socio-cultural conditions.” There is, therefore, no legitimate reason whatever for any religious house to attempt to “turn back the clock” to the pre-Vatican II norms or styles of religious life.\nAnyone attempting to do this are Bad Nuns [insert string of incomprehensible papal insults here.]\nThis is what might be considered the guiding principle of the document; “Nothing to see here.\nAnd if you say there is, you’re the problem.”\nOf course, this kind of bold proclamation is very much in keeping with the habit of this pontificate to simply claim there are no problems and become gravely offended and outraged when the contrary is pointed out.\nIt’s your fault if you find contradictions, not theirs; they’ve said there are no contradictions, therefore there aren’t any.\nAfter all, this is the papacy where 2 + 2 = 5 if the pope says it does.\nThe irony, of course, is built in, since this document is intended as a legal chopping block for the dissolution of any house of contemplative nuns that is judged to be hovering on the edge of extinction or is for some other reason in need of the chop.\nWhy would the Vatican need a document giving extensive norms for the closure of monasteries that have too few nuns or do not follow their originally intended charisms if everything about the religious life since Vatican II has been hunky dory?\nLet’s remember that this comes from the Congregation for Religious of Braz de’Aviz and Jose Rodriguez Carballo.\nThis is the Cardinal Braz de’Aviz[2] who wasted no time in orienting himself in the New Paradigm when, close on the heels of the Conclave he slammed the attempt by his predecessor – and by extension Pope Benedict – to reign in the notorious Leadership Conference of Women Religious in the US.\nHe complained that he had been shut out of the process under Cardinal Rode, and later made a large and public point of appeasing and mollifying the most outspokenly heretical and politicised organisation of female religious in the world.\nApparently the total statistical collapse of the religious life following Vatican II[3] had nothing to do with the massive systemic changes to the forms of that life – always claimed to be “mandated” by “the Council”.\nAnd of course we are talking about the priorities of a pope who has said that seeing a “restorationist” community enjoying a large number of vocations makes him “worry.” Apparently this worry was serious enough to move him to torpedo one of the most flourishing communities in the modern Church; the gaunt spectre of the Franciscan Friars and Sisters of the Immaculate haunts this document.\nAutonomy vs.\nIndependence\nOne of the talking points the media have latched onto is the whole business of “autonomy” of monasteries.\nMany of the headlines crowed: “Vatican confirms nuns’ autonomy,” or similar.\nBut that word does not mean what they think it means.\nIn fact, the word “autonomy” is the key to understanding this whole thing.\nIt appears in the document 16 times and “autonomous” 30 times.\nIn fact, “autonomy” is held up as the single most important criterion for determining a monastery’s viability.\nThis emphasis is repeated so often one might almost think there is a concern in Rome that the “fruitful” post-conciliar monastic life is in danger of fizzling out… for… some reason…\nMonastery sui juris refers to the religious house of a female monastic community that, having the requisites for real autonomy of life, was legitimately erected by the Holy See and enjoys juridical autonomy under the law.\n18 In order to obtain juridical autonomy for a monastery of nuns, it must presuppose a real autonomy of life, that is, the ability to manage the life of the monastery in all its dimensions (vocational, formative, governmental, relational, liturgical, economic ...).\nIn this case, an autonomous monastery is alive and vital.\n43 Autonomy of life, a constant prerequisite for maintaining juridical autonomy, must be constantly verified by the Federal President who, when in her judgment a monastery lacks autonomy of life, must inform the Holy See in view of the nomination of an ad hoc commission.\n67 Affiliation [with another monastery, appointed by the Vatican] can be an opportunity for recovery and rebirth when autonomy of life is partially compromised.\nIf the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery.\nno longer possesses a real autonomy of life , it is the responsibility of the Federation President to report the matter to the Holy See.\nWhen an autonomous monastery , it is the responsibility ofto the Holy See.\nAt the same time, this document is redefining the term “autonomous” to exclude independence.\nWhat got no mention in the brief press interest was the document’s insistence that all monasteries of nuns must belong to a federation and while monasteries must demonstrate “autonomy” they will be granted little in the way of powers of self-governance.\nAs we will see, the federations are now a multilayered system of internal surveillance and centralised control that leaves Orwell in the dust:\novercome isolation and promote regular observance and contemplative life.\nFederation of monasteries means a structure of communion among some autonomous monasteries of the same Institute [4] , erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, so that in sharing the same charism, the federated monasteriesand promote regular observance and contemplative life.\nNote the change: “independent” is replaced with “isolated[5].” It reminds me of a conversation I had with a superior of a Benedictine house in the UK.\nShe said she thought that the psychiatric testing, that in 2008 was still all the rage among the houses of her monastery’s federation, was excessive and not helpful.\nShe didn’t trust the heavily secularised field of psychology to help in determining a candidate’s suitability for religious life, so she didn’t require these tests of her monastery’s postulants.\nShe also said that she was under constant pressure, both the subtle pressure of general peer disapproval and overt requests to conform by the federation’s leadership.\nWas that monastery “isolated”?\nOr just exercising lawful self-governance?\nAnd given that autonomy is being held up as the sole criterion for viability of a monastery, it seems the Holy See is not interested in asking whether it is actually faithful to the charism, or even to the Catholic Faith, a question that has burned brightly for serious Catholics for some time.\nThe word “fidelity” appears in the document four times, which may give an idea of how much interest the Vatican has in this issue.\nFunny you should mention autonomy: Bioethics and the dissolution of “unviable” monasteries\nIt’s funny that the buzzword of the day in Rome should be “autonomy”.\nAs we shall see, the document is what I’ve called above a “chopping block”.\nVultum dei quaerere made it clear that this juridical document would provide a set of legal criteria by which a monastery can be considered viable, religious life worthy of life, so to speak, and that those considered to have failed the test would be closed.\nNote the language used here:\nIf the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery.\nIt jogged a memory for me.\n“Incapacity”… Where had I heard that language used before?\nMost pro-life observers in Britain will tell you that it was the “Mental Capacity Act” of 2005 that established in British law the concept that a person with permanently “reduced capacity” could be legally starved and\/or dehydrated to death by doctors.\nThis is the world, the language, of Bioethics, applied utilitarianism, also called “Principlism” after its three bioethical criteria of “justice, beneficence[6] and autonomy” – it is a patient’s ability to demonstrate his “autonomy” or “quality of life,[7]” either currently or potentially, that decides his fate.\nThis set of criteria is being applied in medical institutions across the western world now, a “new paradigm” of ethics replacing traditional “Hippocratic” or “Natural Law” medical ethics.\nUnder this system the onus, effectively, is on the patient to prove according to the new criteria that he is worthy of receiving medical treatment – of continuing to live.\nMedical treatment (which legally includes food and water) can be withdrawn from patients who fail to demonstrate that they will recover sufficiently to return to an autonomous lifestyle.\nHealth care systems like that of the UK have government regulatory boards giving out “guidelines” to determine in a uniform way how health care resources are allocated.\nThese guidelines are collated by professional Bioethicists applying their utilitarian criteria.\nIf the equation doesn’t come out in the patient’s favour, the “treatment” recommended for the patient’s “best interests” will include his demise, often procured by withdrawing nutrition and hydration and\/or administering slowly lethal doses of sedatives.\nThe NHS in the UK has actually gone to court, and won, declaring that they must retain the right to kill patients who fail the Bioethics test.\nThe result has been a quiet reign of terror in which elderly and disabled people have started carrying cards stating in legalese that they do not want to be killed by their doctors.\nIn one case a man with ALS took the NHS to court in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to preemptively preclude his medical murder when his illness left him incapacitated.\nThe system, in other words, is stacked against the patient, in favour of the government that holds all the cards.\nKeep these facts in mind as we read through the rest of the document.\nI think we can find an almost perfect analogy by replacing the term “patient” with “monastery.” Think about how one would apply concepts like “autonomy,” “viability,” “incapacity,” “quality of life” and “equitable distribution of scarce resources” to this context.\nWhen the language of utilitarianism appears in Vatican documents as guiding criteria for the contemplative religious life, one has to wonder at what point has the entire project gone so disastrously off the rails.\nFederations as Vatican watchdogs\nUnder this law, all monasteries of contemplative nuns must belong to a federation.\nPreviously only voluntary and consultative, federations will now have the power to supervise and guide the formation of candidates, nuns and of their formators, as well as possess broad powers over temporal goods of individual monasteries and powers of suppression.\nThe document makes it inarguable that the federation’s main role will be to establish and monitor for conformity to a particular programme – the “intense and fruitful path” of the Church since 1965 – both within the various orders and between them:\nThe Federal Assembly:\ndeals with issues of major importance; makes decisions and issues norms that all nuns are required to observe, after the definitive approval of the Holy See;\nMore than just federations; a multi-tier system of control\nConference of monasteries means a structure of communion among autonomous monasteries, belonging to diverse Institutes and present in the same region... in particular geographical or linguistic contexts.\nIn other words, Benedictine federations of a given area will form a “Conference” with Carmelite federations and Dominican federations and Poor Clare federations, etc.\nThis will be of interest to Carmelite houses especially, since they tend to be generally more on the “conservative” end of things.\nImagine a house of traditional Carmelites attending regional Conference meetings – and attempting to keep up their Office schedule – with the balloons-and-guitars, break dancing Franciscans…What fun!\nAnd finally, just in case one entire federation decides to turn back the clock, there will be an umbrella for the umbrellas; there will be watchers watching the watchers:\nConfederation means a structure of connection among Federations of monasteries, erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, for the study of themes relative to contemplative life in relation to the same charism, to give unitary direction and a certain coordination to the activity of the individual Federations.\nBroad powers\nFederations will now have extremely broad powers both over money and property and, crucially, over formation of nuns.\nIt is the Federation that now has the power to monitor for compliance with the rules, to report non-compliance to the Holy See, to make new foundations and, apparently, to “encourage” individual monasteries to “communicate” their goods.\nThe legitimately established Federation is a public juridic person in the Church and is therefore able to acquire, possess, administer, and alienate temporal, movable and immovable goods, which are ecclesiastical assets, in accordance with the universal and proper law.\nTo keep alive and strengthen the union of monasteries, implementing one of the aims of the Federation, a certain communication of goods is encouraged among the monasteries, coordinated by the Federal President.\nThe communication of goods in a Federation is implemented through contributions, gifts, loans that monasteries offer other monasteries that have financial difficulties, and for the common needs of the Federation.\nThe Federation considers the assets in its possession as necessary and useful means to achieve its goals.\nFinancial incentives\nGiven that we shall see below that the provisions for suppression of monasteries include vague and indefinable qualities like “vitality in living and transmitting the charism” and “dynamic fidelity” to the order’s charism, and that the goods of extinct monasteries will be assumed by the federation, one might be forgiven for asking if this creates an incentive to see to it that certain houses go extinct[8].\nSince the document provides several mechanisms by which a federation can move nuns out of a monastery, this could be one of those indelicate questions some superiors might want to keep in mind.\nArticle 94 requires that once it is canonically erected the federation is to seek “legal recognition also in the civil sphere.” This, presumably, will bear upon legal disputes in civil courts over the property of suppressed monasteries.\nArticle 73, on the disposition of the material assets of a monastery that has gone completely extinct:\nIn the event of the suppression of a totally extinct monastery, when there are no surviving nuns, unless otherwise provided by the Holy See, the destination of the suppressed monastery's assets, in compliance with canon and civil law, go to the respective higher juridical person, that is, to the Federation of monasteries or to another structure of communion among the monasteries equal to it or to the female monastic Congregation.\nThe economic fund [of the federation] is nourished by the free donations of the monasteries, by the donations of benefactors, and by revenues deriving from the alienation of the assets of suppressed monasteries, as established by the present Instruction.\nFederations in charge of formation\nThe Federation President, in particular, watches over initial and ongoing formation in the monasteries to see if it is in conformity with the charism proper to the Institute, so that every community may be a beacon that illumines the journey of the men and women of our time.\nAt the end of the visit, she will inform the Holy See about the real possibilities that the monastery has or does not have of guaranteeing initial formation.\nThe formation of the formators and their collaborators is entrusted in part to the monasteries and in part to the Federation, therefore, the President of the Federation is called to strengthen formation at the federal level and to require the participation of those who exercise the service of formation; if this does not happen, she will refer the matter to the Holy See.\nThe President of the Federation, having heard the opinion of the Federal Council, chooses the most appropriate places to hold the specific formative courses for the formators and their collaborators, as well as those who are called to exercise the service of authority, establishing the duration of these courses in such a way that they are not detrimental to the needs of the contemplative life and of the community.\nWho makes new foundations and why?\nThroughout the history of the Church, it has been the prerogative of bishops to establish houses of contemplatives in their own dioceses.\nNow, with the pope having forbidden bishops to exercise this ancient right, according to this document, the federations themselves can make foundations.\nthrough the action of the Federation, as established by the Federal Assembly The foundation of a monastery of nuns, keeping in mind what is established in no.\n39 of the present Instruction, can take place either by a single monastery or, as established by the Federal Assembly [9]\nA single monastic community that decides to make a foundation, moreover, must be “helped” and guided by the federation:\nIn discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious Assistant intervene to help the Superior of the founding monastery.\nThe discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.\nArticle 39 tells us some criteria for making foundations that “must be considered in their entirety and from an overall perspective.”\nthe necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism,” composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, “as long as most are not of advanced age”.\na) A community that has given good testimony of fraternal life in common with “” composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, “as long as most are not of advanced age”.\nb) Besides the number, special skills are required of some nuns of the community who must be able to assume: as Superior, the service of authority; as formator, the initial formation of candidates; as financial administrator, the administration of the goods of the monastery.\nc) Rooms adapted to the lifestyle of the community, to ensure that the nuns can regularly lead the contemplative life according to the nature and spirit of their Institute.\nd) Economic conditions that guarantee the community itself can provide for the needs of daily life.\nOne of these things is not like the others.\nDid you notice?\nOne criterion stands out as indeterminate, vague, compared with the other concrete and measurable standards.\nOne aspect of legislative analysis that I learned early was that the terms used are of utmost importance.\nIf a term is vague or is defined incorrectly that is a “loophole”.\nOr it could perhaps be described as a handle; a place where a person who wants to effect a particular outcome can grasp a piece of legislation to use it like an axe.\nSo, how, exactly, is it to be determined – and by whom – that a group of nuns possess “the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism”?\nWhat, precisely, does the term “vitality” mean and exactly how is one to measure out how much is required?\nIs this one of Pope Francis little personal, secret expressions of which only he knows the meaning?\nLike the secret to how nuns are to smile properly?\nDoes the inclusion of completely subjective criteria belong in a juridical document?\nOr is it in there in order to provide cover for prelates?\nThe next article tells us, “It is the responsibility of the Holy See to evaluate the presence of these requisites.” Do they have an electronic meter in a cupboard in the Congregation for Religious that measures “charism vitality”?\nIt seems important to ask because article 70, on how to suppress a monastery, includes it:\nAmong the criteria that can contribute to determine a judgment concerning the suppression of a monastery, after having examined all the circumstances, the following points should be considered as a whole: the number of nuns, the advanced age of the majority of the members, the real capacity for government and formation, lack of candidates for a number of years, lack of the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism in dynamic fidelity[10].\nYou will be affiliated; resistance is futile…\nIt seems there are two themes running through the document: to establish a certain value of “autonomy” as the indispensable criterion for viability, while at the same time asserting top-down oversight and control over who gets to make this determination.\nIn short, a monastery must be autonomous, but heaven help the community that asserts its independence.\nArticles 54-64 offer an interim measure in the case of “incapacity” that is really just more of the second thing.\nOnce a lack of autonomy has been established…\n54 Affiliation is a particular form of help that the Holy See establishes in particular situations in favor of the community of a monastery sui juris which has only an asserted autonomy, but in reality, very precarious or, in fact, non-existent.\n55 Affiliation is configured as a juridical support that must assess whether the inability to manage the life of the autonomous monastery in all its dimensions is only temporary or is irreversible, helping the community of the affiliated monastery to overcome difficulties or to put in place what is necessary to bring about the suppression of this monastery.\nHow does affiliation work?\nWell, the federation and the Holy See between them work it out:\nIn these cases, it is up to the Holy See to evaluate the opportunity of setting up an ad hoc commission formed by the Ordinary, the Federation President, the Federal Assistant, and the Major Superior of the monastery\nIt’s starting to be clear that the federation is going to be little more than the Big Brother hit-squad of the Congregation for Religious.\nIt’s worth remembering what happened in the case of a German men’s monastery in which the superior tried to return the community to pre-Vatican II practices.\nMariawald Trappist monastery – 900 years old – was finally dissolved, affiliated to death.\nIts superior had made the fatal error of openly declaring – in 2008, after the publication of Summorum Pontificum – that the monastery’s problems all began when it adopted the new liturgical rites and implemented the trends of all religious after Vatican II, and that clearly the solution was to go back to pre-conciliar ways.\nMariawald was consequently affiliated, in the manner this document describes, with a liberal house in the Netherlands whose superior, unsurprisingly, discovered that the house was hopelessly divided and could not be saved.\nWhat would make forced affiliation a truly devastating weapon against conservative or traditional communities is the proviso that an affiliated monastery may not form its own novices:\n60 The affiliated monastery can accept candidates, but the novitiate and initial formation must be performed in the affiliating monastery or in another monastery established by the Federation.”\nOf course, this means it is the affiliating monastery’s formation team that would make the determination to dismiss recalcitrant, “neo-pelagian” postulants and novices.\n~\nThis brings us to about article 155 of the document.\nPart two to come.\n_______________\n[1] It would seem, therefore, that a useful task for someone writing about what this pope intends for nuns would be to read Sponsa Christi Ecclesia as well as Francis’ Apostolic Constitution and make a careful comparison.\nI’m not going to do that here, but it might be helpful to examine the two documents with the help of a expert at some point.\n[2] Worth remembering, however, is the fact that it was Benedict the “conservative,” not Francis, who appointed Braz de’ Aviz in the office to replace Cardinal Rode – presumably under that good old “conservative” rubric of the “big umbrella” – under whom these culpably belated attempts to save US religious life were started.\n[3] Just considering the numbers of course.\nLeaving alone the doctrinal issues.\n[4] “The same Institute” means the order in question, whether Benedictine, Dominican, Carmelite etc.\n[5] I’d love to hear from some monastic superior who had the nerve to tell Rome, “Actually, given that all our neighbours in religion are raging neo-modernist heretics, if not schismatics, we think ‘isolation’ is a desirable thing – like quarantine during an outbreak of Bubonic Plague – and would therefore like to be dispensed from the federation requirement.” I’d pay good money to see the shade of purple the well-fed Braz de’Aviz turned.\n[6] “justice and beneficence” are considered on behalf of the community, not the patient\n[7] Bioethicists take it as read that in order for a life to have sufficient “quality” it must demonstrate sufficient autonomy.\nDependence upon the care of others is, quite literally, a capital offence.\n[8] Readers may think I’m exaggerating the danger of material motivations for suppressing monasteries, but as we will see, the distinction between the federations and the Holy See is also a matter of paperwork and it is well to recall that the secretary for the Congregation for Religious, Jose Rodrigues Carballo, was a person of interest to international police agencies for the loss of “tens of millions” of Euros from the coffers of the Franciscan Friars Minor, the original Franciscan order of which he had been the head.\nShortly after Carballo’s appointment, it was revealed that the Swiss prosecutor’s office was investigating the money missing from the Friars Minor in connection with drugs, money laundering operations and gun running.\nCarballo was Francis’ very first appointment, April 6, 2013, three weeks after the Conclave and it was to him that the pope gave the task of the destruction of the FFIs, and a major part of that operation was to separate the FFIs from real assets valued at about 30 million Euros.\n[9] So much for the principle of subsidiarity.\nI can imagine what a monastery founded by a committee would be like to live in.\n[10] We’ll pass over “dynamic fidelity” in silence for now…\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh\n\nUsing any despicable tactic at hand to derail Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation less than a week before the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on whether to approve his nomination, Senate Democrats have sunk to their lowest level of character assassination yet.\nThey have resorted to peddling an allegation of sexual misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh that supposedly occurred while the judge was in high school.\nThe accuser had refused to identify herself before and during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings.\nShe conveniently waited until this Sunday to come forward via an on-the-record interview with the Washington Post.\nThe accuser’s name is Christine Blasey Ford, a registered Democrat who is currently a California professor teaching clinical psychology.\nJudge Kavanaugh issued a statement on Friday in which he said, \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation.\nI did not do this back in high school or at any time.\"\nSenator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee that heard Judge Kavanaugh’s public testimony earlier this month during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, had received last July a copy of a letter written by the woman making the charge, who we now know was Ms. Ford.\nEven though Senator Feinstein had the letter in hand, she never brought up the charge during the public hearing, nor during her own meeting with the judge.\nInstead, Senator Feinstein sat on the letter until late last week, when she issued a cryptic release stating that she had received the letter but did not want to give more details in deference to the woman’s wish to keep the matter confidential.\nSenator Feinstein turned the letter over to the FBI.\nThe FBI placed the letter in its background file on Judge Kavanaugh but decided not to pursue any further investigation.\nSenator Feinstein had initially resisted sharing the contents of the letter with her fellow Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee or to go public with its existence because “the incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion” and she had already “taken care of it,” according to a source quoted by The New Yorker.\nNevertheless, Senator Feinstein evidently bowed to pressure from her leftist colleagues to find a way to insert the allegation into the cesspool of public gossip at the eleventh hour.\nThe New Yorker article, written before Ms. Ford publicly identified herself, provided some details regarding her allegation.\nHowever, now Ms. Ford has decided to do what she called her “civic responsibility” and tell her own story publicly.\nHow convenient, coming just 4 days before the scheduled Senate Judiciary Committee vote!\nThe whole sequence of events surrounding how this allegation has suddenly come to light reeks of a set-up, reminiscent of how Anita Hill surfaced in a last-minute attempt to derail Justice Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation.\nChristine Blasey Ford claims, according to the Washington Post article, that “one summer in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and a friend — both ‘stumbling drunk,’ Ford alleges — corralled her into a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County.\nWhile his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it.\nWhen she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.\n‘I thought he might inadvertently kill me,’ said Ford.\n‘He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.’” Ms. Ford said she was able to escape the room and go home without any apparent further incident after “Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.”\nHere is where Ms. Ford’s story becomes quite murky and begins to fall apart.\nAlthough Ms. Ford believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, she “said she does not remember some key details of the incident,” according to the Washington Post article.\nFor example, Ms. Ford “said she does not remember how the gathering came together the night of the incident.” She also does not remember how she got home.\nYet she claims to be absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, whom she presumably knew only as an acquaintance and said she had not spoken to since the night the incident allegedly occurred, was involved in the alleged incident.\nMs. Ford admitted that she “told no one at the time what had happened to her.” In fact, she said she recalled thinking: “I’m not ever telling anyone this.\nThis is nothing, it didn’t happen, and he didn’t rape me.” Even if one explains this behavior as the natural reaction of a frightened teenager to a highly traumatic incident, that does not explain why, by her own admission, she “told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband,” according to the Washington Post article.\nMost revealingly, the article reported on a gaping hole in the therapist’s notes, portions of which were provided by Ms. Ford for the Washington Post’s review.\nThe therapist’s notes “do not mention Kavanaugh’s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students ‘from an elitist boys’ school’ who went on to become ‘highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.’”\nIn other words, the only written documentation Ms. Ford has offered in support of her allegation about the incident she said took place while she was in high school – a therapist’s notes of a couples therapy session occurring 30 years after the alleged incident – did not mention Judge Kavanaugh’s name.\nJudge Kavanaugh has had extensive background checks performed on him in the past for his various federal government positions, including for his current position as a federal appellate court judge, without the accusation ever having surfaced.\nMs. Ford may believe her story to be true, but the lack of any credible corroborating evidence, her partial memory of details surrounding the alleged incident, and the absence of any pattern of such sexual misconduct by Judge Kavanaugh undercut the reliability of her version of the incident.\nIn a letter addressed to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senator Feinstein, 65 women who said they knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school vouched for his character:\nWe are women who have known Brett Kavanaugh for more than 35 years and knew him while he attended high school between 1979 and 1983.\nFor the entire time we have known Brett Kavanaugh, he has behaved honorably and treated women with respect… Brett attended Georgetown Prep, an all-boys high school in Rockville, Maryland.\nHe was an outstanding student and athlete with a wide circle of friends.\nAlmost all of us attended all-girls high schools in the area.\nWe knew Brett well through social events, sports, church, and various other activities.\nMany of us have remained close friends with him and his family over the years.\nThrough the more than 35 years we have known him, Brett has stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity.\nIn particular, he has always treated women with decency and respect.\nThat was true when he was in high school, and it has remained true to this day.\nThe signers of this letter hold a broad range of political views.\nMany of us are not lawyers, but we know Brett Kavanaugh as a person.\nAnd he has always been a good person.\nNevertheless, using their standard contemptible, obstructionist tactics, the Democrats opposed to Judge Kavanaugh happily seized on the unsubstantiated allegation of teen sexual misbehavior in high school to assassinate Judge Kavanaugh’s character.\nThey have done so in the face of Judge Kavanaugh’s lifetime record of stellar public service, multiple background checks producing no evidence of sexual misconduct, and the letter written by the 65 women, who knew him when he was in high school and thereafter and who signed their names to a ringing endorsement of his good character.\nFeminists gave the serial sexual predator Bill Clinton a free pass because his policies were in line with their ideology.\nSenator Feinstein called Ted “Chappaquiddick” Kennedy an \"inspiration and a friend,\" presumably also based on their compatible ideologies.\nHypocritically exploiting an unsubstantiated allegation of decades-old purported teenage sexual mischief, Democrats seeking to torpedo Judge Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation for ideological reasons have debased themselves with a shameless smear campaign against an eminently qualified candidate for the Supreme Court.\nPredictably, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats, including Senator Feinstein, have called for the Senate to postpone a vote on Judge Kavanaugh.\n\"Senator Grassley must postpone the vote until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated,” Senator Schumer said.\nIf a thorough investigation was considered to be so important, why didn't Senator Feinstein set the ball rolling back in July when she first received word of the allegation?\nThe answer is that this is all a ruse to block Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation by all means necessary.\nSenator Schumer is fulfilling his promise to oppose Judge Kavanaugh with \"everything I've got.\"\nAs of now, the Senate Judiciary Committee Republican majority plans to move forward with Judge Kavanaugh's nomination as scheduled.\nIt is time for the Democrat obstructionists to slink back into their shadowy corner.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Kavanaugh Battle Brews\n\nThe Left’s continuing success in delaying a confirmation vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court reveals its malicious agenda to block the nominee from sitting on the high court when its new term begins Monday, October 1.\nDemocrats had Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford’s never-credible accusations of sexual abuse -- including possible attempted rape -- in hand way back in the summer.\nThey deliberately refused to bring up the allegations, as weak and ridiculous as they are, at Kavanaugh’s Senate confirmation hearings because they didn’t want to have a rational discussion.\nThey wanted to hurl the wild claims like a grenade at the last minute to blow up the process.\nAnd so far it appears they’re succeeding.\nIf Kavanaugh isn’t in place a week from Monday, the Supreme Court will begin hearing cases in its new term shorthanded.\nThe high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have only been eight justices in place.\nRoughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.\nDemocrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they hope to take control from Republicans.\nElection Day is November 6.\nThe GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.\nChristine Blasey Ford’s lawyers are trying to game the system.\nThey know that Senate Judiciary Committee rules require Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to provide a full week’s notice for a hearing.\nSo, if, for example, the committee followed the rules and agreed Friday (today) to a hearing, the soonest it could be held would be next Friday, the final business day before the Supreme Court’s new term begins.\nOf course, lawyers are masters of delay, and social justice warrior-lawyers hoping to torpedo President Trump’s agenda have an added incentive to drag the confirmation process out as long as possible.\nNew demands and fake emergencies are bound to arise from Ford’s legal team.\nIt was unclear at press time if the public hearing scheduled for Monday into the allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh would go forward.\nKavanaugh informed the committee he was willing to testify Monday.\n“I continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name,\" he wrote in a letter.\nFord's lawyer Debra Katz told the Judiciary Committee her client \"wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety.\"\nAnother Ford attorney reportedly said Wednesday that there are “multiple witnesses” who need to testify.\n\"A hearing on Monday is not possible and the Committee's insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event,” Katz wrote in a letter.\n“Dr.\nFord has asked me to let you know that she appreciates the various options you have suggested.\nHer strong preference continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony.”\nGOP lawmakers are figuring out how to respond to Ford’s request, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports:\nLate Thursday, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the Judiciary Committee chairman, said that his staff had discussed the issue with Ford’s attorney earlier in the day and that he would consult with his fellow committee members about the next move.\nFord’s offer also increased the pressure on several key moderates — particularly GOP Sens.\nSusan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — whose votes will probably be needed to put Kavanaugh on the high court.\nBoth were already facing heavy pressure from abortion rights groups concerned that Kavanaugh, a staunch conservative and longtime GOP attorney, might vote to restrict access to abortion.\nThe sexual assault allegation, which the nominee has denied, has upended his seemingly sure-bet confirmation and only increased the stakes for the key lawmakers.\nChairman Grassley had imposed a Thursday deadline for Ford to submit testimony after her team said Tuesday she wasn’t willing to testify until the FBI investigates her sexual abuse allegations against Kavanaugh.\nLeft-wingers such as Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) echoed Ford’s demand.\nThe demand for an FBI probe is “utter nonsense,” former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova said earlier this week.\nFord “really doesn’t want to testify,” he said.\n“Because when she does, she is going to look like the loon she is.\nShe may very well believe everything she’s saying, and that is one of the signs of lunacy, believing something that isn’t real.” And her lawyer is “even loonier.”\nBesides, diGenova explained, the eleventh-hour sexual abuse claim leveled against Kavanaugh is a non-federal matter and in this case the alleged assault hasn’t even been clearly outlined by the alleged victim.\nFord didn’t report it to anyone for decades and isn’t even certain when or where it happened, so the FBI can’t investigate the matter “because there is nothing to investigate.”\nKavanaugh has already undergone six FBI background checks and the agency has ruled out investigating Ford’s allegation of drunken groping at a teenagers’ party 36 years ago.\nFord’s request for an FBI probe is “clearly a desire to delay proceedings,” diGenova said.\nPresident Trump is taking the high road and is avoiding attacking Ford, which isn’t a risky move given how obviously unbalanced the accuser is.\nFord is already doing an excellent job destroying herself without Republican assistance.\nAt the White House on Wednesday, President Trump said it would be \"wonderful\" if Ford testifies and \"unfortunate\" if she does not.\nHe indicated he was keeping an open mind about the allegations but that it was \"very hard for me to imagine anything happened\" between her and the nominee.\n\"I think he's an extraordinary man – I think he's a man of great intellect, as I've been telling you, and he has an unblemished record,\" Trump said.\n\"This is a very tough thing for him and his family and we want to get over it but at the same time we want to give tremendous amounts of time.\nIf she shows up that would be wonderful – if she doesn't show up that would be unfortunate.\"\nCBS News reports that Judge Kavanaugh's wife, Ashley Kavanaugh, has received multiple threats.\n“The text of three emailed threats, obtained by CBS News, were obscene and violent in nature.\nCBS News has confirmed that the U.S.\nMarshal's Service has assigned a protective detail to Kavanaugh's family,” the news website reports.\nThe high-stakes behind-the-scenes jockeying over the confirmation process continues.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|162|178\nLoaded_Language|501|535\nLoaded_Language|652|687\nName_Calling,Labeling|1916|1944\nLoaded_Language|5528|5563\nAppeal_to_Authority|5942|6075\nLoaded_Language|6484|6503\nLoaded_Language|1981|2023\nDoubt|4739|4766\nDoubt|331|373\nCausal_Oversimplification|446|635\nName_Calling,Labeling|1950|1980\nName_Calling,Labeling|3805|3827\nName_Calling,Labeling|4272|4284\nLoaded_Language|4413|4427\nDoubt|4563|4604\nLoaded_Language|4579|4604\nLoaded_Language|4754|4766\nCausal_Oversimplification|5330|5403\nLoaded_Language|5587|5622\nLoaded_Language|6657|6696\nName_Calling,Labeling|4589|4604."}
{"prompt":"Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge\n\n(CNN) Douglas Haig, an Arizona man who says he sold tracer ammunition to the gunman in October's Las Vegas massacre, was arrested Friday on a charge of conspiring to manufacture and sell another type of ammunition -- armor-piercing bullets -- in violation of federal law.\nA criminal complaint alleges two unfired .308-caliber (7.62mm) rounds found in gunman Stephen Paddock's hotel room had Haig's fingerprints on them as well as tool marks from his workshop.\nThe bullets in the cartridges were armor-piercing, with an incendiary capsule in the nose, the complaint says.\nThe FBI on October 19 searched Haig's Mesa home and seized ammunition the agency says is armor-piercing, the complaint said.\nHaig did not have a license to manufacture armor-piercing ammunition, documents said.\nPolice say Paddock, 64, opened fire on October 1 from his 32nd-floor room at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay hotel onto a crowd attending a music festival, killing 58 people and shooting and injuring 422 others.\nMore than 850 others suffered other injuries in the attack.\nInvestigators say Paddock died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.\nDouglas Haig's name was revealed in the release of search warrant records.\nHaig, 55, appeared in court Friday and was released on his own recognizance with specific conditions not spelled out in court proceedings.\nHe is due in court again February 15 for a preliminary hearing.\nThe maximum penalty for manufacturing illegal ammunition is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\nHaig's attorney, Marc J. Victor, told CNN he had no comment.\nCNN affiliate KNXV caught up with Victor outside court, and the lawyer said he couldn't say anything because of the ongoing case.\n\"My first obligation and only obligation is to my client,\" he told KNXV.\nThe complaint\nHaig was publicly linked to the Las Vegas investigation Tuesday when a judge unsealed months-old police search warrant records that named him as a person of interest\nIn a Friday morning news conference before his arrest, Haig, responding to the documents' release, said he sold tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after they met at a gun show.\nTracer ammunition has a pyrotechnic charge that, when fired, leaves an illuminated trace that can help a shooter have a more precise idea of where the bullet is going.\nHaig did not describe the ammunition as armor-piercing.\nVictor, at the same news conference at his Phoenix-area office, said the tracer ammunition that Haig sold Paddock \"was not modified in any way ... from manufacturer's specs.\"\nBut in Friday's criminal complaint, investigators say Haig and an associate also claimed they sold to Paddock other ammunition -- four or five 10-round packages of .308-caliber incendiary ammunition -- at a Las Vegas gun show in August.\nIt's not clear from the complaint whether the two armor-piercing rounds with the incendiary capsule are from the packages Haig allegedly told investigators he sold Paddock at the gun show.\nThe complaint also does not say whether Paddock fired any of the ammunition that he bought from Haig.\nPhotos: Mass shooting at Las Vegas

counsel to the Supervisor of Elections Office.\nEvelyn Perez-Verdia, a former office spokeswoman who left several years ago, said Sunday evening she was told by people in the office that the letter was sent “to Tallahassee” earlier in the day.\nNorris-Weeks said she saw an early draft of the letter.\nIn the version she saw, she said Snipes, 75, expressed a desire to spend more time with her family.\nIn the final version of the resignation letter, sent to Gov.\nRick Scott, Snipes said it was her “passion and honor” to have served in the office.\n“I am ready to pass the torch,” she wrote in the letter, which made no mention of controversies surrounding the 2018 election.\nBy the way, she missed her deadline.\n“Although I have enjoyed this work tremendously over these many election cycles, both large and small, I am ready to pass the torch,” she wrote.\nShe should be ready for prison bars after the fiasco she has created.\nSnipes allowed illegal aliens, non-citizens and felons to vote.\nAccording to Breitbart, she illegally destroyed ballots.\nThree statewide races in Florida are headed to a recount and all depend on results from a county whose supervisor of elections has a history of losing ballots and breaking laws by allowing illegal immigrants and felons to vote, as well as illegally destroying ballots.\nBroward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes’ office has admitted “they don’t know” how many ballots there are still to count.\nSnipes’ latest failure to finalize Tuesday’s election returns days after the polls closed is also in violation of Florida law, which requires elections officials to “report all early voting and all tabulated vote-by-mail results to the Department of State within 30 minutes after the polls close.\nThereafter, the canvassing board shall report, with the exception of provisional ballot results, updated precinct election results to the department at least every 45 minutes until all results are completely reported.”\nThe irony that a constitutionally ineligible candidate for the presidency and RINO extraordinaire, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), pointed out that voter fraud going on in Florida just a day after the elections probably didn't help the pressure that Snipes was facing.\nNo evidence of fraud in #FloridaElection?\nDems got voters to use altered forms to fix & submit as many mail ballots as possible after FL deadline in hopes that a judge would later order state to count them.\nToday that’s exactly what a federal judge did.\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/MC4Tlvy9gi — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) November 15, 2018\nNaples Daily News:\nA day after Florida’s election left top state races too close to call, a Democratic party leader directed staffers and volunteers to share altered election forms with voters to fix signature problems on absentee ballots after the state’s deadline.\nThe altered forms surfaced in Broward, Santa Rosa, Citrus and Okaloosa counties and were reported to federal prosecutors to review for possible election fraud as Florida counties completed a required recount in three top races.\nBut an email obtained by the USA TODAY NETWORK – Florida shows that Florida Democrats were organizing a broader statewide effort beyond those counties to give voters the altered forms to fix improper absentee ballots after the Nov. 5 deadline.\nDemocratic party leaders provided staffers with copies of a form, known as a “cure affidavit,” that had been modified to include an inaccurate Nov. 8 deadline.\nWe also know that a Broward County employee, Chelsey Smith, signed an affidavit affirming that she had seen members of Snipes' staff engaging in voter fraud.\nShe ignored a court order, mixed invalid provisional ballots in with valid ones, and destroyed ballots, but don't worry, a Democrat attorney says that doing so has nothing to do with fraud or corruption.\nNow that federal prosecutors have gotten involved, perhaps it's time to quit talking about it and actually arrest this woman and charge her with crimes against the people of Broward County before more people end up dead in Broward County over their corrupt voting practices.\nArticle posted

{"prompt":"Did Oakland Mayor Tip Off La Raza to ICE Raid?\n\nThe story of the Oakland mayor who tipped off illegal alien criminals to ICE raids resulting in rapists and child sex offenders escaping arrest just keeps getting worse.\nOakland Mayor Libby Schaaf shocked the nation when she issued a tweet and press release on February 24 warning about impending ICE raids.\nSchaaf refuses to say how she learned about the ICE raids, only saying it was not from official sources.\n“I felt that it was my duty to share the information,” Schaaf said.\nWhatever the leak pipeline looked like, it's good odds that it began with Obama holdovers ensconced in the government.\nIn emails we obtained through a public records request, we didn’t find out who her sources were, but we do know who she was talking to before she made her big announcement.\nEmails reveal that hours before the announcement, a group called Centro Legal de la Raza sent the mayor information on what employers should do in case of an ICE raid.\nHours before the public was warned about ICE raids, some Oakland businesses got a head start, thanks to the mayor.\nAccording to emails, the Oakland Indie Alliance, a group of independent businesses, got a message saying “Important Alert!\nCredible information ICE Raids in Oakland Sunday 2\/25 and Monday 2\/26” and “This information comes directly from the Mayor.”\nNow that last part is significant.\nBecause there is no doubt that businesses employing illegal aliens are committing a crime.\nIt is unlawful to hire an alien, to recruit an alien, or to refer an alien for a fee, knowing the alien is unauthorized to work in the United States.. An employer can be convicted of the felony of harboring illegal aliens who are his employees if he takes actions in reckless disregard of their illegal status, such as ordering them to obtain false documents, altering records, obstructing INS inspections, or taking other actions that facilitate the alien’s illegal employment.\nAny business that tips off illegal aliens admits that it is aware of their status.\nBy passing along the warning, Mayor Schaaf was tipping off criminals committing a felony.\n>","completion":" Appeal_to_Authority|569|644\nLoaded_Language|1745|1763\nLoaded_Language|192|216\nLoaded_Language|245|252\nLoaded_Language|1395|1476."}
{"prompt":"Assange Never Met Manafort.\nLuke Harding and the Guardian Publish Still More Blatant MI6 Lies\n\nThe right wing Ecuadorean government of President Moreno continues to churn out its production line of fake documents regarding Julian Assange, and channel them straight to MI6 mouthpiece Luke Harding of the Guardian.\nAmazingly, more Ecuadorean Government documents have just been discovered for the Guardian, this time spy agency reports detailing visits of Paul Manafort and unspecified “Russians” to the Embassy.\nBy a wonderful coincidence of timing, this is the day after Mueller announced that Manafort’s plea deal was over.\nThe problem with this latest fabrication is that Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry.\nNeither Manafort nor these “Russians” are in the visitor logs.\nThis is impossible.\nThe visitor logs were not kept by Wikileaks, but by the very strict Ecuadorean security.\nNobody was ever admitted without being entered in the logs.\nThe procedure was very thorough.\nTo go in, you had to submit your passport (no other type of document was accepted).\nA copy of your passport was taken and the passport details entered into the log.\nYour passport, along with your mobile phone and any other electronic equipment, was retained until you left, along with your bag and coat.\nI feature in the logs every time I visited.\nThere were no exceptions.\nFor an exception to be made for Manafort and the “Russians” would have had to be a decision of the Government of Ecuador, not of Wikileaks, and that would be so exceptional the reason for it would surely have been noted in the now leaked supposed Ecuadorean “intelligence report” of the visits.\nWhat possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort?\nFurthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency – who were in charge of the security – would not know the identity of these alleged “Russians”.\nPreviously Harding and the Guardian have published documents faked by the Moreno government regarding a diplomatic appointment to Russia for Assange of which he had no knowledge.\nNow they follow this up with more documents aimed to provide fictitious evidence to bolster Mueller’s pathetically failed attempt to substantiate the story that Russia deprived Hillary of the Presidency.\nMy friend William Binney, probably the world’s greatest expert on electronic surveillance, former Technical Director of the NSA, has stated that it is impossible the DNC servers were hacked, the technical evidence shows it was a download to a directly connected memory stick.\nI knew the US security services were conducting a fake investigation the moment it became clear that the FBI did not even themselves look at the DNC servers, instead accepting a report from the Clinton linked DNC “security consultants” Crowdstrike.\nI would love to believe that the fact Julian has never met Manafort is bound to be established.\nBut I fear that state control of propaganda may be such that this massive “Big Lie” will come to enter public consciousness in the same way as the non-existent Russian hack of the DNC servers.\nAssange never met Manafort.\nThe DNC emails were downloaded by an insider.\nAssange never even considered fleeing to Russia.\nThose are the facts, and I am in a position to give you a personal assurance of them.\nI can also assure you that Luke Harding, the Guardian, Washington Post and New York Times have been publishing a stream of deliberate lies, in collusion with the security services.\nI am not a fan of Donald Trump.\nBut to see the partisans of the defeated candidate (and a particularly obnoxious defeated candidate) manipulate the security services and the media to create an entirely false public perception, in order to attempt to overturn the result of the US Presidential election, is the most astonishing thing I have witnessed in my lifetime.\nPlainly the government of Ecuador is releasing lies about Assange to curry favour with the security establishment of the USA and UK, and to damage Assange’s support prior to expelling him from the Embassy.\nHe will then be extradited from London to the USA on charges of espionage.\nAssange is not a whistleblower or a spy – he is the greatest publisher of his age, and has done more to bring the crimes of governments to light than the mainstream media will ever be motivated to achieve.\nThat supposedly great newspaper titles like the Guardian, New York Times and Washington Post are involved in the spreading of lies to damage Assange, and are seeking his imprisonment for publishing state secrets, is clear evidence that the idea of the “liberal media” no longer exists in the new plutocratic age.\nThe press are not on the side of the people, they are an instrument of elite control.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Hungary PM Viktor Orban Vows to “Fight Those Who Want to Change the Christian Identity of Europe”\n\nHungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been somewhat of a lone voice in Europe against the Muslim invasion, and on Wednesday he gave a \"Hungary First\" speech in which he declared that he would \"fight those who want to change the Christian Identity of Europe.\"\n“Our presidency has taken a stand: we cannot give in to extortion,\" Orban said in a video statement on Facebook.\n\"For us, Hungary is first.\nWe will fight those who want to change the Christian identity of Hungary and Europe.”\nElnökségi ülés után Elnökségi ülés után \/\/ After the meeting of the presidency Posted by Orbán Viktor on Wednesday, February 7, 2018\nOrban's words are reminiscent of those of US President Donald Trump, who spoke about putting \"America First.\"\n\"The presidency of Fidesz has discussed yesterday the announcement of the Belgian Prime Minister, that they will – if necessary with force – obligate Central European countries, including Hungary, to accept migrants,” Orban stated.\n“According to their plan, this will happen in June at the summit of the prime ministers in Brussels,\" he added.\n“Our presidency has taken a stand: we cannot give in to extortion.\nFor us, Hungary is first.\"\n“We will fight those who want to change the Christian identity of Hungary and Europe,” Orban concluded.\nAccording to the Hungarian Government's website, posted about the ultimatum that was given over the weekend.\nOver the weekend, Belgian prime minister Charles Michel spoke about sending “an ultimatum” to the Visegrád countries which “reject solidarity”.\nThe essence of this ultimatum would be that if by the end of June a consensus is not reached in the council of EU heads of government, then the planned reforms would be adopted with a qualified majority vote which would overrule dissenters.\nMinister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó said on Tuesday,“Hungary will not become an immigrant country, it has never admitted and will never admit illegal immigrants.\"\nHe also referred to Michel's ultimatum as unacceptable and shocking.\n“Hungary has never admitted and will never admit illegal immigrants, irrespective of whether there is any pressure in this direction along the borders or from Brussels,” Szijjártó said.\n“The Belgian Prime Minister’s statement is also outrageous because this is the first time that people in Brussels are openly planning to push the mandatory resettlement quota through by force while totally ignoring the will of certain EU member states.\"\n“We regard this whole thing as unacceptable and we reject it,\" he added.\n“The countries of the Visegrád Group do not support the introduction of any kind of mandatory quota.”\n“Perhaps it doesn’t bother the Belgian Prime Minister that there are no-go zones in many Western European cities, or that people with immigrant backgrounds have committed 27 major terrorist attacks in Europe recently, but this bothers the V4 because they do not want to live on a continent were the threat of terrorism becomes an everyday regularity,\" he continued.\nJust this week, we reported that Hungary had grown weary of the talks of pushing illegal Muslim migrants on their country and Europe, and was preparing to walk away from the negotiating table.\nOrban has taken a tough stance in Hungary.\nHe has ordered all illegal Muslim invaders to get out of Hungary and never come back.\nIn December, he said that he was not concerned with what Brussels wanted, but was determined to defend Hungary's borders.\nPM Orban has done just that, too.\nOrban's border wall virtually eliminated illegal immigration.\nOrban is openly Christian and seems to understand something that many do not and that is you do not allow a wholesale flood of antichrists to pour into your country.\nWere the Ammonites and Moabites not kept out of the assembly of Israel because of their hatred of the people of God?\n(Deuteronoy 23:3-6) Yes, they were.\nWhile Muslims need the Gospel for sure, one cannot allow such an influx into the country, or all you are asking for is the judgments God warned about in Deuteronomy 28.\nI say, well done Mr. Orban.\nI would like to hear more of that kind of talk from America's representatives.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|2351|2361\nFlag-Waving|68|96\nRepetition|545|585\nRepetition|1270|1353\nLoaded_Language|2090|2115\nLoaded_Language|3756|3776\nRepetition|2118|2184\nRepetition|3361|3376\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|3804|3940\nRepetition|296|361\nLoaded_Language|1938|2047\nLoaded_Language|3341|3418\nName_Calling,Labeling|3361|3376\nFlag-Waving|3647|3663\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|2854|2939\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|3997|4124\nFlag-Waving|238|251\nSlogans|238|251\nFlag-Waving|476|500\nSlogans|476|500\nFlag-Waving|815|828\nSlogans|815|828\nRepetition|1242|1266\nFlag-Waving|1938|2045\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|3027|3081\nThought-terminating_Cliches|4133|4142."}
{"prompt":"Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall\n\nA new Senate report reveals that Barack Obama secretly paved the way for Iran to tap into U.S. banks to convert cash it received from sanctions’ relief to dollars — despite the face the White House assured lawmakers it would do no such thing.\nThe report shows how State Department and Treasury Deparment officials during the Obama era quietly gave a special license for a major Omani bank to do business with two U.S. banks.\nBarack Obama spent considerable time selling the American people on the idea of a cooperative Iran — all the while cutting quiet deals, behind closed doors, with the rogue nation.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of

the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nThe U.S. banks were pressured into complying with the deal.\nThe Washington Times has more:\nThe Obama administration — despite repeatedly assuring Congress that Iran would remain barred from the U.S. financial system — secretly mobilized to give Tehran access to American banks to convert the windfall of cash it received from sanctions relief under the 2015 nuclear deal into dollars, an investigative report by the Senate has revealed.\nA copy of the report, obtained by The Washington Times, outlines how Obama-era State and Treasury Department officials discreetly issued a special license for the conversion to a major Omani bank and unsuccessfully pressured two U.S. banks to partake in the transaction, all while misleading lawmakers about the activities.\nThe document, compiled by the Senate’s Republican-led chief investigative subcommittee, began circulating Tuesday, just as the Trump administration issued its harshest warnings to date to foreign governments and companies to avoid doing business with Iran or find themselves in the crosshairs of Washington’s reimposition of sanctions as part of Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal.\n“Companies doing business in Iran face substantial risks, and those risks are even greater as we reimpose nuclear-related sanctions,” said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.\nShe also called on foreign governments to harden their financial systems against “deceptive” Iranian transactions that ultimately channel money to terrorists.\nThe Iranian government “uses shell and front companies to conceal its tracks” as part of an elaborate scheme designed to procure cash for the Quds Force of Iran’s militant Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, Ms. Mandelker said.\nShe issued the warnings in a speech at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank as Iran announced Tuesday that it was formally moving ahead with preparations to increase its nuclear enrichment capacities — the sharpest response to date by the Islamic republic to Mr. Trump’s pullout from the nuclear accord.\nIranian officials said the increase, while provocative, does not violate its commitments under the nuclear accord.\nThe president sent shock waves around the world with his May 8 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear pact and begin reimposing U.S. sanctions, which the U.S., Europe, China and Russia had collectively lifted in 2015 in exchange for Iran’s promise to curb its suspect nuclear programs and allow international inspections.\nWhile Iran told the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency on Tuesday that it plans only to increase enrichment within limits set by 2015 deal, the announcement came with threats from a top Iranian official that the activities could be quickly expanded.\nThe warning put fresh pressure on European leaders to keep the nuclear accord alive despite Mr. Trump’s withdrawal.\nThe head of Iran’s nuclear agency, Ali Akbar Salehi, said Tehran is prepared to dramatically increase its capacity for enrichment but that the work so far is limited to building a facility for assembling the centrifuges.\nHe made the comment a day after Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered the increase in capacity and vowed that Iran would preserve its nuclear program despite the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 accord.\nThe Senate report focuses new scrutiny on the lengths President Obama’s team was willing to go to ensure the deal’s success as it was still being negotiated.\nThe Senate Homeland Security Committee’s permanent subcommittee on investigations probe contends that the Obama administration went out of its way to keep U.S. lawmakers in the dark about calculated and secretive efforts to give Tehran a back channel to the international financial system and to U.S. banks, facilitating a massive U.S. currency conversion worth billions of dollars.\n“Senior U.S. government officials repeatedly testified to Congress that Iranian access to the U.S. financial system was not on the table or part of any deal,” according to a draft copy of the document obtained by The Times.\n“Despite these claims, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, at the direction of the U.S. State Department, granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system.\n“Even after the specific license was issued, U.S. government officials maintained in congressional testimony that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system,” the report said.\nSen.\nRob Portman, the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, is set to outline his panel’s findings Wednesday.\nUnder terms of the nuclear deal, Iran was given the right to reclaim billions of dollars in state assets and bank accounts frozen by international sanctions, but it remained “illegal for U.S. persons, entities, and financial institutions to do business with Iran or parties on behalf of Iran.”\nThe ban included any “intermediary” transactions by U.S. banks to convert currency for Iran — a development that would have elevated the value of the Iranian assets on the global market and allowed Tehran to more easily move the money through the international banking system.\nOn the day the nuclear deal was implemented in 2015, Tehran had some $5.7 billion worth of assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat, Oman, according to Senate investigators, who said Tehran moved quickly to request access to the U.S. dollar.\nOn Tehran’s request, Bank Muscat contacted the U.S. Treasury Department’s office of foreign assets control.\nAccording to the Senate report: “Muscat sought to convert $5.7 billion in Omai rials into euros.\n[But] because the rial is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the most efficient conversion was with an intermediary step through a U.S. bank using U.S. dollars.”\nObama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2015 that Iran would “continue to be denied access to the [U.S.] financial and commercial market” under the proposed accord, but the Treasury office went ahead with attempts to quietly allow the currency transaction sought by Iran.\n“On February 24, 2016, OFAC issued a specific license to Bank Muscat authorizing Iranian assets worth roughly $5.7 billion to flow through the U.S. financial system,” according to the Senate report, which claims the move was made “even though U.S. sanctions prohibited it.”\nEven as office of foreign assets control officials directly “encouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds,” the Treasury Department continued to deny it was working to facilitate the currency transaction, said the report, which cites a 2016 letter from the department to Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, and Sen. Mark Kirk, Illinois Republican, that contended the Obama “administration has not been and is not planning to grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system.”\nThe catch, according to Senate investigators, was that neither of the U.S. banks approached by the office of foreign assets control would take on the Iranian currency exchange — in part because of political concerns over the prospect of being found out to have secretly circumvented the remaining ban on U.S. transactions with the Islamic republic.\nDespite the Obama administration’s efforts, Iran was ultimately forced to convert its Bank Muscat assets to euros in small increments using European banks and without accessing the U.S. financial system, the Senate investigators said.\nMr. Portman said in a statement Tuesday night that “the Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran.”\n“Despite claims both before and after the Iran deal was completed that the U.S. financial system would remain off limits, the Obama administration issued a specific license allowing Iran to convert billions of dollars in assets using the U.S. financial system,” Mr. Portman said.\n“The only reason this transaction wasn’t executed was because two U.S. banks refused, even though the administration asked them to help convert the money.”\nSuch sanctions, he added, “are a vital foreign policy tool, and the U.S. government should never work to actively undermine their enforcement or effectiveness.”\n>","completion":" Flag-Waving|531|546\nFlag-Waving|8629|8648\nName_Calling,Labeling|648|660\nLoaded_Language|3287|3292\nLoaded_Language|4034|4046\nName_Calling,Labeling|2113|2122\nRepetition|3108|3117\nRepetition|3930|3939\nExaggeration,Minimisation|1298|1314\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|2160|2290\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|3800|3836."}
{"prompt":"A Sister Speaks: ‘Cor Orans is the Death-Knell of Carmel’\n\nUnder the first part of my ongoing analysis of “Cor orans,” a commenter wrote: “When the enemy wants to take a soul, he tries to make it give up prayer.”\nThe Vatican presents a choice: the world, or Christ.\n“The Prologue [of the Rule of St. Benedict] set this choice before us, the world or Our Lord, as mutually exclusive alternatives; we cannot remain neutral, but must belong wholly to the one or wholly to the other.”\nDom Paul Delatte, OSB, Abbot of Solesmes\nToday I received an email from a monastery of cloistered Carmelite nuns about the new document from the Vatican’s Congregation for Religious.\nThey’re helping me examine this document, having kindly volunteered to serve as consultants, to help me understand it from an inside position.\nThese, I might add, are not what we would consider a “traditionalist” community.\nThey have only the Novus Ordo Mass and use the new rite Divine Office in their native vernacular language.\nFor obvious reasons I can’t identify them, even to say what country they are in.\nWriting to me in English, by way of introductory comments in their longer analysis of the document that will be forthcoming, Sister T, fully professed and a senior member of the monastery’s council, said, “The Cor Orans document is the death-knell of Carmel.\nIt signals the end of the contemplative monastic life.\nNot only does it destroy the autonomy of the Monasteries, something Our Holy Mother St. Teresa was extremely insistent about, but it also removes the Superior, dissolves her authority and power, removes the financial independence of each Monastery, and destroys the specificity of each charism.\n“This is a disaster.\nEspecially for Carmel.”\nI contrast this frightening comment with those coming from the man immediately responsible for “Cor orans,” Cardinal João Braz de Aviz, the Brazilian prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in a speech to religious formation directors in 2015, in which he laid out pretty clearly what was coming in this piece of legislation, 3 years later.\nIn fact, as the National Catholic Reporter piece said, the meeting itself was “unprecedented,” 1200 formators of religious life gathered by the Congregation for Religious in order to hear the new marching orders.\nThis is the programme:\n“Do not distance yourself from the great lines of the Second Vatican Council.” “In fact, those that are distancing themselves from the council to make another path are killing themselves – sooner or later, they will die.\nThey will not have sense.\nThey will be outside the church.\nWe need to build, using the Gospel and the Council as a departure point.”\nAfter breathing this threat, the cardinal continued, saying that because modern people’s “needs” are fundamentally different from what they were in the past, there was no reason to stick too closely to what the founders and foundresses – people like St. Anthony, St. Augustine, St. John Cassian, St. Benedict, St. Bruno, St. Dominic, Sts.\nFrancis and Clare, Sts.\nTeresa of Avila and John of the Cross - wanted.\n“These contexts have changed.\nAnd the council reminds us that consecrated life must be Christian discipleship ... must be discipleship of the founders that we remember, but also must be open to the culture of the present moment.”\n“We must not be closed to new things.\nGod is not static,” the cardinal said.\n“God is always new movement – of light, of heat, of demonstration.\nHe speaks in every time to men and women with the true language of that time.”\nThe congregation’s Secretary, Archbishop José Rodríguez Carballo, is reported as saying, “With this explicit reference to the Second Vatican Council, we point to our profound conviction that the council is the point of reference, non-negotiable, in the formation to the consecrated life.”\nNot the charism of the order, nor the rule, nor the Patristic tradition, nor the Doctors, nor the mystics, nor any of the 2000-year-old tradition of religious life, from the Desert Fathers to the giants of the Tridentine period; just Vatican II.\nAnd only, apparently, a single “interpretation” of it, if we are to judge by the soap and oil Braz de Aviz poured on the ruffled feathers of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious – the most virulently anti-Catholic organisation of “Catholic” religious in the world – and by his vicious persecution of the Franciscans of the Immaculate.\nCarballo continues his remarks, giving us a clue as to his feelings towards strictly cloistered, contemplative religious life: “A consecrated life, a life in God but inserted in the ecclesial family, in the church – inserted in the world.\nNot in conflict with the world, but inserted in continuity,” he said.\nIt is to wonder what this man would make of a comment by the great Dom Paul Delatte, the second abbot of Solesmes and successor to the refounder, Dom Gueranger, who wrote in his commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict:\n“The Prologue set this choice before us, the world or Our Lord, as mutually exclusive alternatives; we cannot remain neutral, but must belong wholly to the one or wholly to the other.”\n“After entering into Christ by baptism and by the monastic profession, we should hold ourselves as far aloof from the world as possible and have no connection with it.\nThere shall no longer be more intercourse between us than there is between two corpses: ‘The world is crucified to me and I to the world.’\n“Let us be on our guard against thinking that it may sometimes be proper to soften the differences, to lessen the distance which separates us.\nThe Apostle warns us that we can only please God by preserving the integrity of our true life: ‘No man being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses: that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.’ The world itself is scandalised by our condescending to it, and the words of the Imitation [of Christ] are always fulfilled: ‘Sometimes we think to please others by our company; whereas we begin rather to be displeasing to them by reason of the bad qualities they discover in us.’”\nHow Cor orans will end St. Teresa of Avila’s reform of Carmel\nSister T. continued, saying that the document explicitly derogates the founding intentions of St. Teresa for whom real autonomy was a crucial element of her Carmelite reform.\nShe acknowledges that cloistered orders of nuns have for some time been gathered into federations.\nThese are already doing the Cor orans programme, having shared initial formation programmes for postulants and novices, “ongoing formation” courses for professed nuns, a federal abbess or president who oversees all the federated monasteries.\nTheir funds are already interconnected and they have regular meetings with and input from the male branches.\nIn 2015, Carmelite monasteries received a questionnaire from the Father General Fr.\nSaverio Cannistra, a Mexican and devotee of Liberation Theology, to ask if they wanted an International Commission of Nuns to oversee the female houses place of the Carmelite Fathers.\nThis suggestion was rejected, to the annoyance of Maccise.\nMaccise also promoted the idea of having no superiors in the individual monasteries, but only federation presidents and shared formation of novices.\nThe push for these changes is still on, however, under the current General, an Italian, Saverio Cannistrà.\nGiven the Marxist leanings of the recent crop of Fathers General, it seems clear that what can be expected by “ongoing formation” is, in essence, some form of political indoctrination, sprayed over with a micro-thin layer of pious language.\nBut for Carmelite nuns, Sister said, these ideas are the antithesis of the intentions of St. Teresa.\nAuthentic autonomy, independence of formation and finances, “are essential points of our charism that Our Holy Mother established and to do away with them is to do away with the charism.”\n“They go against our Constitutions, even though Cor Orans states that everything is to be done in accord with the charism and Constitutions.\nEach Carmel has its own spirit, its own tempo, it’s own ‘feel.’ Each nun is called not just to the Order, but to a specific Carmel.\nFormation in common is something we’ve been fighting against for years.”\n“To have a federal president who can decide to take the novices away, or take all our finances, or tell the Holy See we’re no longer ‘viable’ – this is a disaster.\nSt. Teresa specifically set up the monasteries so that none of this would take place.\nAnd now it’s going to be done to us.”\nShe points to the extended length of formation for new nuns - previously six years for Carmelites and under Cor orans now nine years, as absurd, saying it will tend to impede new vocations.\n“As though the Church is going to ask laypeople to be engaged for nine years before they marry.\nOur Constitutions already provide a three year extension of temporary vows if needed, but to make it mandatory will dissuade women from entering.\nIt will also help the monastery become ‘less viable’ because by the time anyone younger is professed, the others will be dead.”\nAnother requirement will be for a “religious assistant,” a priest monitoring the monastery in addition to a chaplain, to be assigned by the federation.\nSister writes that this was rejected “years ago” by Carmelite monasteries as undue interference.\nThe religious assistant will have unprecedented powers.\nArticle 23 states, for instance, “In discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious assistant intervene to help the superior of the founding monastery.\nThe discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.”\n“One other thing that is very striking to me is the complete loss of our rights.\nThere are no options in this document, no choices, no recourse.\nIt’s all being done to us.\nIn this day and age, when Pope Francis is proclaiming, if not Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, then at least license and ‘choice’ for all, plus the ‘rights’ of women, here our rights are completely taken away.”\nAnother nun has written saying that they cannot conceive of what these people mean by “ongoing formation”.\nJudging from other documents from already-federated Carmelites in Europe, it means in practical terms going in groups away from the monastery for days or weeks at a time to take “courses” together with novices from other monasteries.\nThe content of these course, of course, is to be formulated by teams of “experts” chosen by the Federation.\nSister writes, “Cloistered nuns have a very full horarium that does not allow for a lot of other things.\nWe already have to deal with the million unexpected things that come up each day.\nI have no idea how we are going to implement all these ridiculous plans of ‘on-going formation’.\nCan they not comprehend that simply faithfully living our daily life provides plenty of on-going formation.”\nApparently not.\nAs I wrote in my first analysis piece, the document itself – that we must remember is a piece of legislation, a legal document laying out what all monasteries of contemplative nuns must now do – starts by laying out its working premise:\nPope Francis, in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II, intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades, in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio-cultural conditions.\nIn other words, it is the “intense and fruitful path” of the last few decades of the Church since Vatican II that all monasteries of cloistered, contemplative nuns must now take.\nAnyone who imagines that this document’s authors will allow leeway, that there will be dispensations forthcoming for traditional or “conservative” communities from timid and cowed Vatican bodies like Ecclesia Dei, has failed to pay attention.\nIn the last 20 years, “conservative” Catholics have pointed to the flourishing – mainly in the US – of some groups of sisters who had turned away from the “intense and fruitful path” and re-established some of the traditional accoutrements of the religious life.\nThey point to the Nashville Dominicans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Poor Clares of Alabama, where there are at least habits, (some) chant, common life and common apostolates.\nBut it is these signs of refusal of the programme that have infuriated the despots of the New Paradigm who would not rest until every last individual house of religious life was co-opted, subverted to the new ideology.\nThe little green shoots of hope that the faithful Catholic world so rejoiced to see are to be stamped back into the frost of Vatican II’s perpetual winter.\nIn the continuing analysis that will follow this article, we can see that the purpose of this document is to fulfill the totalitarian fantasies of the anti-Catholic revolutionaries, now nearing the end of their lives 50 years after their initial near-triumph.\nIts intention is mopping up; either to herd the remaining recalcitrants – those who have resisted even to the softened and conciliating degrees typical of “conservatives” – into the full post-conciliar “reform” instituted by the revolutionaries in the 1960s – or to close them.\nThe thing is, the result will obviously be the same either way.\nThe whole world has seen what happens to religious life that takes on the VaticanTwoist New Paradigm.\nI have just received a document that was issued privately summarising the findings of a meeting of federated Discalced Carmelite nuns in Europe in 2009.\nThe numbers are absolutely dismal.\nFederation: Belgium\nnumber of convents: 11 Number of nuns: 120\nsolemnly professed: 119\nin formation: 1 average age: 73\nFederation: Belgium - Luxembourg.\nnumber of convents: 11 number of nuns: 122\nsolemnly professed: 117\nin formation: 5\naverage age: 75\nFederation: Germany number of convents: 14 number of nuns: 178\nsolemnly professed: 170\nin formation: 8\naverage age: 66\nThe rest are similar, and I’ll be analysing this document in some detail in the next piece in this series, but the rest of the responses to the Father General’s questionnaire tell a similar story.\nThe German federation gave a summary of the efforts made to address these issues.\n“Path taken: For 15 years they have organized formation courses: on-going & initial formation, and for formators.\nMeetings for prioresses.\nPresent Problems: Have got very old.\nSome sisters are in care-homes run by Franciscans.\nPossible Solutions: Two convents intend to amalgamate.”\nThis is the death spiral.\nAnd it is precisely this “intense and fruitful path” taken by nearly all the Catholic world’s monastics since 1965 that Cor orans is attempting to force on the very, very few holdouts.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"DOJ Unseals Indictment Involving Uranium One Scandal\n\nThis report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge\nThe Department of Justice unsealed an 11-count indictment on Friday to a former DoD intelligence analyst-turned uranium transportation executive who stands accused of a bribery and money laundering scheme involving a Russian nuclear official connected to the Uranium One deal.\nThe indictment corroborates a November report by The Hill that an FBI mole deeply embedded in the Russian uranium industry had gathered extensive evidence of the scheme.\nMark Lambert, 54, of Mount Airy, Maryland, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering.\nThe charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.\nAccording to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at “Transportation Corporation A” to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX.\n–DOJ\nWhile the indictment lists Lambert’s company as “Transportation Corporation A,” a simple search reveals that Lambert is the co-President of DAHER-TLI, “the leading front end freight forwarding company dedicated to Nuclear Cargo,” according to its website.\nIn 2012, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent a letter to Lambert with findings that TLI had exported plutonium “in excess of the maximum quantity and type applied for and licensed,” and “exported Australian obligated material, which was not authorized under license conditions.”\nPrior to his 26 year tenure in the transportation industry – 20 of which have been with TLI, Mr. Lambert was an Arabic Linguist for the Navy for five years, and a Senior Intel Analyst for the Department of Defense (DoD) for three years.\nLambert also speaks fluent Arabic and Farsi (Persian), along with French and Italian.\nThe indictment against Lambert corroborates prior reporting by The Hill that an FBI mole buried deep within the Russian nuclear industry had gathered extensive evidence of a scheme involving bribes and kickbacks between Russian nuclear officials and TLI – which would have transported the U.S. uranium sold to Russia in the ’20 percent’ Uranium One deal.\n“The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns.\nAnd none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.”\nBased on what the FBI knew – including evidence which purportedly includes a video of Russians preparing briefcases of bribe money – the Uranium One deal never should have gone through.\nMoreover, both Robert Mueller and current deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were directly involved – and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other Justice Department officials appear to be covering for them.\nIn short, the FBI had ample evidence of the Russian bribery plot before the Obama administration approved the Uranium One deal thanks to their embedded mole in the Russian nuclear industry.\nThe informant – outed as energy consultant William Campbell – was “threatened” by Obama admin AG Loretta Lynch to keep quiet with an iron-clad gag order, according to his attorney – former Reagan Justice Dept.\nofficial and former Chief Counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee Victoria Toensing.\nAfter Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-VA) demanded Campbell be allowed to testify in front of Congress, the gag order was lifted.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions originally tried to claim that there was no connection between Uranium One and the nuclear transport bribery case, however several congressional republicans pushed back:\n“Attorney General Sessions seemed to say that the bribery, racketeering and money laundering offenses involving Tenex’s Vadim Mikerin occurred after the approval of the Uranium One deal by the Obama administration.\nBut we know that the FBI’s confidential informant was actively compiling incriminating evidence as far back as 2009,” Rep. Ron DeSantis, (R-Fla.) told The Hill.\n“It is hard to fathom how such a transaction could have been approved without the existence of the underlying corruption being disclosed.\nI hope AG Sessions gets briefed about the CI and gives the Uranium One case the scrutiny it deserves,” added DeSantis, whose House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittees is one of the investigating panels.\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a similar rebuke last week to Rosenstein, saying the deputy attorney general’s first response to the committee “largely missed the point” of the congressional investigations.\n“The essential question is whether the Obama Justice Department provided notice of the criminal activity of certain officials before the CFIUS approval of the Uranium One deal and other government decisions that enabled the Russians to trade nuclear materials in the U.S,” Grassley scolded.”\nMeanwhile, journalists John Solomon and journalist Sara Carter claim to have copies of the FBI informant’s evidence, while Carter issued an explosive report in late November laying out the players, the timeline, and the evidence at hand.\n“By the time the sale of Uranium One was approved by the Obama Administration, the FBI’s investigators had already gathered substantial evidence and the bureau was also aware of Russia’s intentions to enter the U.S. energy market and its desire to purchase a stake in American uranium,” Carter writes.\nHighlights:\nFBI mole William Campbell was a highly valued FBI asset – paid $51,000 by FBI officials at a celebration dinner in Chrystal City, VA, where Campbell’s attorney says they thanked him for his service.\nCampbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money – which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian “nuclear money laundering apparatus”\nCampbell collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period\nCampbell uncovered a Russian plot to penetrate the Obama administration and gain approval for the Uranium One sale, including a 2010 email which describes “Russia’s intent on expanding its Uranium expansion in the United States.”\n“This is not just about bribery and kickbacks but about a U.S. company that was transporting yellow-cake for the Russians with our approval,” an unnamed U.S. Intelligence official told Carter, adding “This should raise serious questions.\nAt the time everyone was concerned about Russia’s ties to Iran, we still are.\nAnd of course, Russia’s intentions and reach into the U.S. energy market.”\nGiven Friday’s unsealed indictment, however it looks like the DOJ may have changed their tune on Campbell.\nIf so, perhaps that “briefcase full of bribe money” video will finally see the light of day.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|1369|1376\nLoaded_Language|1381|1391\nFlag-Waving|3019|3036\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|3937|3949\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|2307|2350\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|2356|2414\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|2432|2516\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|4053|4079."}
{"prompt":"A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge\n\nGym is Trenton Tolliver’s favorite class.\nBut the 7-year-old is also a huge fan of the weekly Bible course at Princeton Primary, his public elementary school.\nHe gets to play matching games about Bible stories and listen to classic tales.\nNoah and the Ark is a favorite.\nAdam and Eve and the garden of Eden, of course.\nAnd the story about how their son Cain killed his brother, Abel.\n\n“That one was a little bit of a surprise,” Trenton said as he sat with his parents, Brett and Courtney Tolliver, one day this month watching his little sister’s soccer practice on a lush field in this small town in the mountains of southern West Virginia.\n\nThis spring, Bible classes such as Trenton’s are on the minds of many here in Mercer County.\nFor decades, the county’s public schools have offered a weekly Bible class during the school day — 30 minutes at the elementary level and 45 minutes in middle school.\nBible classes on school time are a rarity in public education, but here they are a long-standing tradition.\nThe program is not mandatory, but almost every child in the district attends.\nAnd there is widespread support for the classes: Parents and community members help raise nearly $500,000 a year to pay for the Bible in the Schools program.\nNow Bible in the Schools is facing a stiff legal challenge.\nTwo county residents with school-age children argue in a lawsuit that the program violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment and the West Virginia constitution.\nFiled in January and amended last month by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the suit charges that the Bible class “advances and endorses one religion, improperly entangles public schools in religious affairs, and violates the personal consciences of nonreligious and non-Christian parents and students.”\n\nSupporters are adamant that the weekly class is an elective meant to explore the history and literature of the Bible, not to promote religious belief.\n“My experience with it has been very positive.\nI’ve never known of anyone who has been pressured or felt ostracized,” said the Rev.\nDavid W. Dockery, senior pastor at First Baptist Church of Princeton.\n“Any time God’s word can be proclaimed is beneficial and is a good thing.”\n\nTrenton’s parents also find it hard to see why there would be objections.\n\n“I think it’s a great program mainly because it’s the only chance for some of these kids to even see the Bible,” said Brett Tolliver, 27.\n“More importantly, I don’t know who it harms.\nThe kids aren’t forced to be there.”\n\nCourtney Tolliver, 26, a teacher in the district, agrees.\n\n“It’s not teaching religion, but it teaches character and respect and how important it is to tell the truth,” she said.\n“The kids love it and the ones who don’t participate aren’t made to feel left out.”\n\nBut the plaintiffs in the suit and their backers argue that the program’s popularity shouldn’t matter in the face of Supreme Court rulings such as McCollum v. Board of Education in 1948 that have banned public schools from initiating or sponsoring religious activity.\nThe suit alleges that the lessons in the Mercer schools are similar to what a child would hear in Sunday school and that they advocate the Ten Commandments and treat stories in the Bible as historical fact.\nThe suit quotes from one lesson: “If all of the Israelites had chosen to follow the Ten Commandments, think of how safe and happy they would have been.” Another lesson asks students to imagine that humans and dinosaurs existed at the same time.\nIt says: “So picture Adam being able to crawl up on the back of a dinosaur!\nHe and Eve could have their own personal water slide!\nWouldn’t that be so wild!”\n\nThe district declined a request to observe one of the classes.\nElizabeth Deal, who describes herself as agnostic, is one of the plaintiffs in the case.\nHer daughter attended elementary school in nearby Bluefield, but Deal kept her out of the Bible class.\nEven though the class was optional, Deal said there weren’t any alternative lessons or activities for those who opted out.\nHer daughter was told to sit in the computer lab for that half-hour and read a book.\nBypassing the class left her vulnerable to bullying.\nDeal said other students told her daughter that she was going to hell.\nOne day a student saw her daughter reading a “Harry Potter” novel and told her, according to the mother: “You don’t need to be reading this.\nYou need to be reading the Bible.”\n\nEventually Deal moved her daughter to a public school a few miles away in Virginia where there is no Bible class.\nShe pays an out-of-state fee of several hundred dollars, but she no longer worries about her child being taunted.\n\nDeal said she joined the suit because she believes strongly in the separation of church and state.\n“When something is wrong,” she said, “you have to stand up against it.”\nGod is a big deal in Mercer County, home to about 125 churches that dominate the main streets of its biggest towns, Princeton (population 6,400) and Bluefield (10,400), and smaller burgs such as Athens (1,000), Bramwell (360) and Oakvale (120).\nA lot of the good jobs in the county have left — 22 percent of its 61,000 residents live below the poverty level — but the churches have stayed.\nYou can find the Church of God here.\nAnd the Church of Christ.\nAnd the Church of Jesus.\nThere are a couple of Catholic churches, a synagogue and a mosque, but the vast majority of houses of worship are Baptist, Methodist or Pentecostal.\nThe radio in the region is filled with gospel stations, Bible talk shows and Christian rock.\nBillboards tout the Ten Commandments or offer stern messages on abortion and eternal salvation.\nBeneath a Chick-fil-A billboard in Princeton, another asks: “If you die tonight.\nHeaven or Hell?”\n\nThe Rev.\nRay Hurt has been the lead pastor at the Church of God in Princeton for more than two decades.\nThe church, one of the largest buildings in town, can hold up to 2,000 people for Sunday services and often does.\nFor Hurt, Bible in the Schools, which has been in the public schools here in one form or another since 1939, is simply a way for students to further their knowledge.\n\n“There is a great deal of not just poetry and prose in the Bible, but from what I’ve read almost every piece of history that’s in the Bible has eventually been proven,” he said.\n“We see the Bible not just as a book of faith but as a pretty accurate account of history that informs us about a lot of things that happened.”\n\nHurt, whose son, the Rev.\nJ.B. Hurt, is also a minister in the Church of God and a member of the county school board, says he would oppose the program if he thought it was being used to teach religion or if students were required to take the class.\nBut he also embraces the idea that the Bible offers irrefutable lessons in morality and teaches the difference between right and wrong.\n\n“If you read the Bible, you’re going to get a whole lot of good ideas that are going to stick with you and make you a better person,” he said.\n“You don’t have to push religion with it.\nIt speaks for itself in terms of morals and ethics and those things.”\nThe idea that a weekly Bible class for 6,600 students in 16 public elementary schools and three middle schools is somehow simply an academic offering doesn’t sit well with Lynne White, 54, a former two-term school board member and mother of two sons who went through Mercer schools.\n\n\n“As a person of faith myself, I don’t see any problem with having an after-school Bible program,” White said.\n“But to me this seems a pretty clear violation of the Constitution.”\n\nWhite holds the school board and leadership responsible for spreading what she says is a false sense of what the Bible in the Schools program is and does.\n\nIn a commentary for the Charleston Gazette-Mail, White wrote that “the Bible in the schools program in Mercer County is being sustained on a foundation of lies.”\n\nShe argued that the classes are character education based on biblical values, that they were not electives because West Virginia doesn’t offer electives in elementary or middle school and that even though the classes are funded by private donations, that doesn’t mean they should be taught during the instructional day.\nShe also said it was untrue that children who didn’t take the class weren’t made to “feel different or ostracized.”\nWhen White posted the article on Facebook, she heard from some supporters, but many others questioned her faith.\n“I will pray for you and all non-believers Lynne White.\nGod Bless!\n!” one wrote.\n\nAnother wrote:\n\n“Lynne White You are not a Christian, a Christian is a person who strives to be more Christ like with everything they do and I do not believe Christ would be working to shut this program down or alter it to include your worldly views.”\nIf it were simply a popularity contest, Bible in the Schools would be allowed to continue as is.\nEven the president of the local mosque in Princeton says it should stay.\n\n“It’s good to be God-fearing no matter how you approach it,” said Mohammad Iqbal, head of the Islamic Society of the Appalachian Region.\n“Whether it’s the Bible, whether it’s Koran, whether it’s Torah, whether it’s some other book.\nBut it should be optional, not enforced.\nIf the parents have no objection and the student has no objection, it is okay.”\n\nBut the program’s fate will not be resolved by popular vote or on Facebook posts.\nInstead, the question will be tried in the courtroom of Judge David A. Faber of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia in Bluefield.\n(Faber was nominated by President George H.W.\nBush.)\n\nRepresenting the Mercer school district is the First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit law firm based in Texas that specializes in religious freedom cases.\nHiram Sasser, a lawyer at the firm, said the district’s main objective is to allow the Bible course to remain as an elective while making sure it complies with the law.\nThe district filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on Wednesday.\n\n“There are two things to look at,” Sasser said.\n“The first is whether you can have a Bible course at all.\nAnd the other is whether you can have the Bible course as it is presently constituted.\nIt’s fair to say that we’re very confident on the first issue.\nAnd on the second issue .\n.\n.\nour client is very, very flexible in terms of making sure that the content is in compliance with the law.”\n\nBut the plaintiffs aren’t looking for flexibility.\nThey want the Bible class out of the school day.\nThe program “is unconstitutional at its core and cannot be saved via modifications,” said Patrick Elliott, a lawyer with the Freedom From Religion Foundation.\n“There is no legally permissible way for Mercer County Schools to continue with any type of program like this.”\n\nAccording to Elliott, the Mercer program is “extremely rare” and there are only a handful of districts around the country with similar courses.\nThe amended complaint, Elliott said, seeks to prevent the school system from “organizing, administering, or otherwise endorsing Bible classes for Mercer County Schools’ students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade.”\n\nCharles C. Haynes, the founding director of the Religious Freedom Center at the Newseum in Washington, doesn’t foresee the program surviving a court challenge in its current form.\n\n“This is a loser for the school district,” Haynes said.\n“It’s difficult to satisfy the First Amendment in elementary school when it comes to the Bible.\nStudents at that age really aren’t prepared to tell the difference between what is history and what is religious conviction.”\n\nHaynes argues that people of faith are doing their religion a disservice when they try to have it taught by a government entity.\nThey would rightly object, he said, if they lived somewhere where they were the religious minority and supporters of another religion wanted a course on their faith taught in public schools.\n\n“Even if 99.9 percent of the people in the community want it, they need to remember that liberty of conscience is not up for a vote,” he said.\n\nTrenton Tolliver is oblivious to the Bible battle that swirls around him.\nHis first-grade school year ends next month.\nHanging in the balance of the court case is what he will learn in the Bible course in second grade.\nOr if there will be a Bible course at all.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|7925|7943\nLoaded_Language|147|151\nName_Calling,Labeling|2262|2272\nName_Calling,Labeling|2280|2292\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|4198|4249\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|4427|4497\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|4307|4320\nLoaded_Language|4779|4787\nLoaded_Language|7582|7594\nName_Calling,Labeling|8607|8630\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|9598|9650\nLoaded_Language|10340|10350\nLoaded_Language|10851|10860\nSlogans|12045|12087\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|5776|5811."}
{"prompt":"New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”\n\nIt should be clear by now that the entire official narrative surrounding the Las Vegas shooting that left 59 people dead and hundreds injured is falling apart.\nFrom shooter Paddock’s check-in date and the existence of a second person in his room, to possible connections to a terrorist organization, as well as the the actual timeline of events, everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny.\nIn the last 24 hours the Sheriff’s Department has significantly revised the event timeline and a key incident involving the shooting of a Mandalay Bay security guard.\nOriginally, as highlighted by The Daily Sheeple, the security guard was hailed as being responsible for preventing the shooter from continuing his massacre because he interrupted him in the middle of the attack.\nAs it turns out, security guard Jesus Campos was actually shot BEFORE Paddock opened fire on the concert crowd below his 32nd floor hotel suite.\nAs part of the constantly changing story, officials are now saying that police officers who rushed to the hotel room when the shooting began didn’t know a hotel security guard had been shot “until they met him in the hallway after exiting the elevator,” Lombardo said.\nThe security guard, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman, from behind his door, shot into the hallway on the 32nd floor.\nPaddock apparently detected Campos via surveillance cameras he set up outside his hotel suite, police have said.\nPaddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time, Lombardo said, shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes.\nPolice officers found Campos when they arrived on the floor.\nAnd Campos did not summon police to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, according to the timeline recently updated by the authorities.\nWhat’s also incredibly interesting, is that eyewitnesses claim to have seen security guards chasing another security guard in the minutes leading up to the massacre.\nThe hotel guest in the room next to Paddock also saw “multiple gunmen.” The Full Report: The Ever-Changing Vegas Narrative: Gunman Shot Security Guard Before Massacre\nAs of today, here is the revised timeline, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times:\nThe new timeline has left investigators and researchers with new questions, two of which are extremely important:\nWhat happened during the 6 minutes between Campos being shot and Paddock opening fire, and why weren’t the police rushing to the scene immediately?\nWhy did shooter Stephen Paddock stop shooting?\nPaddock had already shot the security guard, waited six minutes before opening fire on the concert crowd, and then shot for a full ten minutes.\nPolice didn’t arrive for two additional minutes after the shooting stopped – which is a full 18 minutes from the moment Campos was initially hit.\nMoreover, did he stop shooting because he was planning his escape from the 32nd floor?\nOr is it possible that Paddock was rushed and in a state of panic?\nAccording to links and information shared by Thomas Wictor and a timeline assessment by Twitter user Mr. Alex, the plausibility of Paddock accidentally killing himself amid the confusion, adrenaline and panic is quite high:\nLatest LV Sheriff: Saying they still don’t know why he stopped shooting.\n@drawandstrike theory looking plausiblehttps:\/\/t.co\/CQF3MZLHaN — Mr Alex ???\n(@New_England_) October 10, 2017\nWhile we may never know the exact circumstances surrounding what transpired in the shooter’s hotel room, the information being released not just by law enforcement, but witnesses to the event who recorded hundreds of cumulative hours of video and audio, now calls the entirety official story into question.\n>","completion":" Doubt|2630|2685\nDoubt|1115|1140\nDoubt|3585|3632."}
{"prompt":"Trump Orders Declassification Of ‘Russian Probe’ Documents, Including Texts\n\nPresident Donald Trump ordered the feds to declassify documents relating the Russian election meddling investigation yesterday.\nAmong the documents to be declassified are all of the text messages between disgraced FBI figures Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.\nThe documents to be declassified include all FBI reports on interviews with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all other applications to surveil Carter Page.\nTrump also asked that other important documents be declassified as well, including 21 pages worth of an application for a renewed surveillance warrant against former campaign aide Carter Page, according to Fox News.\nThe 21 pages Trump wants to be declassified only make up a small part of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in heavily redacted format.\nThe June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year.\nAccording to the redacted version as reported by Fox News, three of the declassified pages contain information included in a section titled “The Russian Government’s Coordinated Efforts to Influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.” That section includes reference to the potential coordination between people associated with Trump’s campaign and the alleged Russian election interference effort.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said President Trump had ordered the documents released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department “[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency.”\nThe text messages are to be released “without redaction,” and those include messages from Ohr, Strzok, Lisa Page, former FBI Director James Comey, and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\nCarter Page told Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Monday night that the FBI’s investigation was “so incredibly stupid to begin with.” He added, “My biggest concern is all the damage that this did to the U.S. government [and] the mockery it made out of the Constitution and all of the wrongdoing that was done by various officials within the Department of Justice, the FBI and the DNC [Democratic National Committee].”\nIt is so far unknown when these documents will be declassified in an unredacted version, but it is safe to say that Democrats are probably panicking right about now.\nFox News further reported that a source familiar with the timing of the declassification told the media outlet that they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first, followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr.\nA Justice Department spokesperson told Fox News that the DOJ and FBI “are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President’s order.”\n>","completion":" Flag-Waving|2145|2414\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2097|2131\nLoaded_Language|2557|2582\nName_Calling,Labeling|108|116\nName_Calling,Labeling|281|302\nLoaded_Language|2225|2268\nDoubt|2269|2414."}

{"prompt":"Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal\n\nArchbishop Bernard Hebda of St. Paul, MN, responds to the McCarrick scandal (The Catholic Spirit):\nEvery time Mass is celebrated, the priest prays that Jesus will “look not on our sins but on the faith of [his] Church… .” That’s been an important prayer for me in the time that I have been serving this archdiocese, well aware of our sins but equally aware of the strong and vibrant faith of this local Church.\nI’ve been praying that prayer even more earnestly in these past weeks as the Church in the United States has once again come face-to-face with its sins, with reports that former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, one of the most prominent Churchmen in the United States in the last quarter century, has been accused of abusing two minors and sexually harassing or assaulting a number of seminarians and young priests.\nTo make matters worse (if that is even possible), evidence has surfaced that indicates that a bishop, as well as some priests and laity, had brought the allegations about misconduct with seminarians to the attention of Church authorities but to no avail: Archbishop McCarrick was nonetheless “promoted” to become the archbishop in our nation’s capital, and elevated to the College of Cardinals.\nWhile I realize that it is not always easy to evaluate the credibility of those bringing allegations, and that there’s often a tendency to believe those we know over those we don’t, I don’t think that the Church in the United States will rest — and confidence will be restored — until the matter is independently investigated and explained, and assurances are given that there are safeguards in place to make sure that something like this couldn’t happen again.\nThe matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that I had served in the Archdiocese of Newark as coadjutor archbishop from November 4, 2013, to March 25, 2016, when I was named archbishop here.\nIt was while I was in Newark that I was introduced to then-Cardinal McCarrick.\nA number of good Catholics have written to ask for a personal accounting on my part, inquiring whether I was made aware in my time in Newark of the 2005 and 2007 settlements involving Archbishop McCarrick, or if I knew of any allegations against him.\nI can state unequivocally that I learned of those settlements only in June of this year, as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the Archdiocese of New York.\nWhat I know of the settlements I know from the newspapers.\nWhen serving in Newark, I was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts, but not on past legal matters (unless they were still being discussed in the press).\nBy the time I arrived in Newark in November 2013, the 2005 and 2007 settlements were apparently considered ancient history.\nIt would be untrue to state that I had never heard any allegations about Cardinal McCarrick.\nYears before I ever lived in Newark, and never imagining that I would be assigned there, I had indeed read — as a somewhat geeky ex-lawyer — an allegation about Cardinal McCarrick in the context of a 2005 lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Archbishop Myers, Cardinal Eagan, Bishop Hubbard and the Irish Christian Brothers.\nWhile the complaint didn’t supply any details, the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that “Archbishop McCarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them.” The complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation.\nKnowing, however, that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts, I never gave the particular allegation about Cardinal McCarrick any credence.\nI can also state without exception that no one in my years in Newark ever told me that they were improperly touched by Archbishop McCarrick, and no one ever told me that they had to share a bed with him or that they had seen anyone share a bed with him.\nI heard lots of gut-wrenching stories in my two-and-a-half years there, but none of them involved Archbishop McCarrick.\nWith St. John Paul II’s 1995 visit, he was remembered for “bringing a saint to Newark,” not as an abuser of seminarians, minors or priests.\nWhen I was installed here in St. Paul, he joined me at lunch along with my father, sister, godmother and then 12-year-old nephew.\nI can assure you that I would never have allowed that to happen if I had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month.\nWhile the letters and emails of recent days are sober reminders that there’s still a long way to go in restoring trust, I nonetheless welcome the efforts to hold me accountable to you, the faithful of this archdiocese.\nThe events of these past weeks have shown that no one can be above the law, regardless of rank or privilege.\nI was grateful for the opportunity to reinforce that with our seminarians this past weekend, and I look forward to continuing my work with the Office of Ministerial Standards and Safe Environment, and our Archdiocesan Review Board, in creating a culture in which no one need be afraid or reluctant to bring forth an allegation of misconduct.\nOur heavenly patron, St. Paul, reminds us that “where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more.” May these difficult days be days of great grace for this local Church.\nREMNANT COMMENT: While we certainly appreciate His Excellency's candid explanation of what he knew and did not know about this horrific scandal in the Church, we would also humbly beg him to take it one step further by publicly proclaiming his profession of belief in the Church's official teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts and the so-called \"gay lifestyle,\" which includes her long-held teaching that homosexual activity between clerics is an ecclesiastical crime.\nFar from being reassured of this by their bishops, many Catholic faithful today are informed that the modern Catholic Church is now an \"inclusive community\" that \"welcomes all\" and \"judges none.\"\nAll very well and good, except for the fact that the Church's constant and unchanging moral teaching on this makes no such allowance.\nIn fact, this binding and constant teaching of the Church was reaffirmed most recently in her most authoritative modern catechism, which holds the exact opposite position from that apparently held by many bishops:\nHomosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex... Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that \"homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.\"\nThey are contrary to the natural law.\nThey close the sexual act to the gift of life.\nThey do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity.\nUnder no circumstances can they be approved.\n(Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357)\nUnder no circumstances…except for those dreamed up by a number of bishops in this country who apparently think that it should be left up to individual parishes to decide if they are LGBTQ-friendly or not.\nEven Pope John Paul \"The GREAT's\" Vatican clarified the Church's teaching on October 31, 1986, in the “Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons”:\nAlthough the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.\nTherefore special concern and pastoral attention should be directed to those who have this condition, lest they be led to believe that the living out of this orientation in homosexual activity is a morally acceptable option.\nIt is not.\nNotice the late pope does not say, “Let the practicing homosexuals have a spiritual home among your faithful,” as Father James Martin and his episcopal fans are at least implying on a regular basis in the media.\nDoes Archbishop Hebda believe it is time for the Church to stop humiliating herself by stooping to accommodate a special interest group that obviously doesn't care about her or the moral code by which she governs?\nDoes he believe that all Catholics must follow the rules of the Church pertaining to the Sixth Commandment...or just the straight Catholics?\nDoes His Excellency believe that if some homosexual Catholics feel they need not bother following the rules they should be warmly welcomed into our \"Catholic Christian\" community anyway, even if they are in same-sex unions?\nPope John Paul certainly didn't accept that.\nIn his 2005 book Memory and Identity, John Paul referred to homosexuality as an “ideology of evil,” insisting of so-called 'gay marriage' that:\n“It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, perhaps more insidious and hidden, which attempts to pit human rights against the family and man.”\nWas Pope John Paul THE GREAT an intolerant homophobe?\nAre Father Martin and his pals in the episcopacy really so enlightened over every pope, saint, and moral theologian in history?\nOr is it not so that it is both negligent and uncharitable for some bishops to refuse to inform their faithful that according to the Church's own infallible teaching, everlasting damnation is the price to be paid for this kind of inclusivity and toleration?\nAnd if the episcopal retort is going to be that this acceptance refers only to chaste homosexuals, then we call FOUL even louder since this crosses the line into willful deception.\nWe're all sinners, of course--- and the Church already accepts repentant homosexuals as they are, just as she accepts repentant practitioners of ANY sins of the flesh.\nSo why are our bishops playing dumb?\nQuite obviously, it is because what they are actually closing an episcopal eye to are the folks who want to keep right on sinning--and sinning proudly.\nThis is what the Church of Accompaniment is all about!\nBut, practically speaking--in the real world--this kind of \"accompaniment\" is only green-lighting vice and mortal sin, and as such constitutes a hideous violation of everything these bishops supposedly believe as Catholic priests.\nSo what's going on here?\nWho are these bishops that think they can play fast and loose not only with the moral theology of the Catholic Church, but also with the immortal souls of their flock?\nIs it any wonder that priests and laity alike are changing their attitude on the \"gay lifestyle\" and violations of the Sixth Commandment when so many bishops are working to remove the stigma attached to this sin that Scripture tells us cries to heaven for vengeance?\nThe Catholic Church's new-found \"climate of tolerance\" is exactly what McCarrick and company are counting on!\nIt is truly homophobic for any bishop to lie to the gay community about this, and to risk the immortal souls of the sheep merely so that the shepherd might pride himself on occupying the politically correct high ground.\nThis is gross dereliction of duty, and we hope and pray that all the good U.S. bishops would jump at the opportunity to issue statements reaffirming the Church's clear teaching against all sins of the flesh, homo- and heterosexual.\nAgain, God bless Archbishop Hebda for this welcome statement, and may God grant him the courage now to finish the task by publicly reassuring the scandalized faithful that it’s not just abuse of minors or sexual harassment that’s going on here.\nOur bishops must make it absolutely clear that the Church's moral theology on homosexuality will not and can not be trumped by the dictates of political correctness.\nAnd neither can God's law be changed to accommodate the spirit of our “most enlightened” age---which is, of course, an evil spirit that can be driven out only by prayer and fasting.\nUntil the Church and her bishops get back to reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on human sexuality we can forget about seeing an end to the sexual abuse crisis and the massive problem of homosexuality in the clergy.\nMcCarrick will become the norm, not the exception, and confidence in the leadership and moral authority of the Catholic Church will remain in the toilet indefinitely... exactly as the forces of darkness intended all along.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara\n\nLa Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replied to Chris Ferrara’s articles on Fastiggi and Goldstein’s defense of Amoris Laetitia and their criticism of the Filial Correction:\n\n\nFastiggi’s exchange with Ferrara concerning “Wait, Wait, It’s all a mistranslation!”\n\nRobert Fastiggi • 13 hours ago\n\nIn the article that I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein, we would have done better to speak of the “official” Latin text rather than the “original” Latin text.\nThis, though, is no longer an issue because the normative text is the Latin text published in thr AAS.\nMr. Ferrara, however, bases his critique upon an assumption that the “generous response” offered to God is a sin.\nThis, though, is not what AL is saying.\nThe generous response is a move away from sin and a move toward God.\nI explain this in my most recent response to Prof. E. Christian Brugger, which can serve as my response to Mr. Ferrara:\n\nPosted on LifeSiteNews:\nProf. Brugger is a good theologian and a fine man, but he still seems to believe that AL 303 implies that God is asking people to continue to sin in some cases.\nIn his April 22, 2016 article in Catholic World Report, Brugger writes that AL 303 suggests that “God can be ‘asking’ someone to live in a life-state in which they are objectively violating grave matter.” Then in a Sept. 28 ‘17 LifeSiteNews article, he states that “the generous response” owed to God is “a certain state that is objectively at variance with the universal command of the Gospel.” Now Prof. Brugger argues that, because the subject remains “this conscience” in AL 303, this proves that the “generous offering owed to God” is the recognition that one is living “contrary to “the universal command of the Gospel.”\n\nProf. Brugger fails to see that AL 303 clearly distinguishes between a conscience’s recognition that “a given situation is objectively at variance with the general mandate of the Gospel” and this same conscience’s subsequent recognition of a “generous response owed to God in the present circumstances.” The subject “conscience” might be the same but the object is different.\nThe “generous response” is not the situation that is at variance with the command of the Gospel but an offering that God is asking amid the mass of impediments even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model.\n\nWhat might be this “generous response?” Pope Francis does not give an example in AL 303 because he’s speaking in general terms of the dynamics of conscience.\nMoreover, he knows that concrete cases vary widely.\nIn our Sept. 26 article in La Stampa, Dr. Goldstein and I provided a hypothetical example of a couple in a purely civil “marriage” recognizing that God is calling them to live in continence.\nWe chose this example deliberately to demonstrate that “the generous response” could be the ending of a particular sin.\nOur example was an attempt to show that Professors Brugger and Seifert are wrong to believe AL 303 implies that God is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state.\nIt’s really just the opposite.\nAL 303 teaches that conscience will come to recognize that God is asking for a step in the right direction away from sin.\nPope Francis explains this again in AL 305 when he says “a small step, in the midst of great human limitations, can be more pleasing to God than a life which appears outwardly in order, but moves through the day without confronting great difficulties.’”\n\nIn a recent interview (http:\/\/www.lastampa.it\/2017..., the Italian philosopher, Rocco Buttiglione, provides this example for AL 303: “Imagine a father who has a sick son and the child improves.\nHe still has fever but has stopped vomiting; the child manages to keep in his stomach what he eats and has started a therapy that seems to work.\nThe father is happy.\nIs he happy about the fact that the child is sick?\nNo, he is pleased that his son gives symptoms of improvement and healing.”\n\nThis is what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303.\nGod is not happy with situations that are objectively at variance with the command of the Gospel.\nGod, however, is happy when people in such situations discern in conscience that He is asking them to make a choice that moves in the right direction—even if they still need to progress further toward a more complete fulfillment of His will.\nThis is the law of gradualness not the gradualness of the law.\nIt is sad that this beautiful and compassionate message of AL 303 has been so completely misunderstood by scholars who have failed to grasp its true meaning.\n\nChris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 9 hours ago\n\nI certainly agree that the Latin text is the normative text even if it comes later.\nI certainly do not agree that the Latin text eliminates the grave problems with Amoris Laetitia.\nRather, as I show in my article, it only intensifies them.\n\nWith all due respect to Dr. Fastiggi, his argument and that of Buttiglione, that a “move away from sin” is what is pleasing to God, even if the moral norm is not adhered to, is sophistical.\nWhat constitutes a “move away” from sin if not ceasing to commit the sin?\nNo example is provided in AL because none can be.\nThe notion is nonsensical.\nJust how nonsensical is demonstrated by Dr. Fastiggi’s claim that by “a move away from sin” in the case of a divorced and “remarried” couple Francis means their agreement to live in continence as brother and sister for the sake of children.\nBut that would be ceasing to commit the sin of adultery altogether as it would involve abandoning the pretense that they are married along with the illicit sexual relation itself.\nSuch a couple could always be absolved and receive Holy Communion under the Church’s constant practice, albeit privately to avoid scandal.\n\nAt any rate, the “brother and sister” approach to the situation, which is that of Familiaris consortio 84, is certainly not the one advocated by Francis.\nAs my article shows, Francis has made it quite clear that he approves of admitting to the sacraments divorced and “remarried” people who will continue to live as if they were married, including sexual relations, while “discerning” their situation, this “discernment” being a mere fig leaf to conceal the proposed toleration of public adultery in the Church.\nThus, Francis thanked the Maltese bishops for their AL guidelines, which literally mandate admission to the sacraments of divorced and “remarried” people who believe themselves to be “at peace with God.” And, as he told the bishops of Buenos Aires in writing, “there is no other interpretation.”\n\nNo amount of verbal artifice can conceal what is happening in the Church thanks to AL: Public adulterers are being admitted to Holy Communion without an amendment of life and the bimillenial discipline of the Church---which John Paul insisted involves a moral norm, not a mere ecclesiastical law, to which everyone is bound in conscience “without exception”---is being overthrown in place after place.\n\nIt is a great disservice to the Church to maintain the pretense that there is nothing problematical about AL.\nA moral catastrophe is self-evidently underway and it is not possible honestly to deny its cause.\n\nRobert Fastiggi to Chris Ferrara • 2 hours ago\n\nThank you for your response.\nYou write well but you do not reveal a proper understanding of what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303.\nI can only ask that you to study the matter more carefully with an open heart and mind.\n\nChris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 16 minutes ago\n\nTell that to the four cardinals, the 800,000 faithful, the 45 theologians and the 61 other original signers of the correctio, all of whom you insult with your superficial and I must say entirely sophistical attempt to explain away what Francis is clearly doing.\n\nIrony of ironies, the latter-day Pharisees and legalists Francis sees around every corner are hard at work defending Amoris Laetitia at the very moment it is being cited by bishop after bishop as their sole authority for admitting public adulterers to Holy Communion---while Francis does nothing but approve.\n\nI think you should follow your own advice about studying this matter with an open heart and mind, but above all with open eyes, for you have clearly shut them to what is going in the dioceses in the name of AL.\n\nFastiggi’s exchange with Ferrara concerning “More Fake News: La Stampa Tries Again.”\n\nRobert Fastiggi • 12 hours ago\n\nI would like to thank Christopher Ferrara again for calling attention to an article I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein in La Stampa.\nI give him credit for his colorful style.\nUnfortunately, Mr. Ferrara provides no real evidence for his claim that Pope Francis “wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers in 'second marriages' to the sacraments while continuing their adulterous relations.”\n\nHe mentions the Holy Father's letter to the Buenos Aires bishops, but he fails to take into account that the statement of those Argentine bishops can be interpreted in an orthodox way, as Cardinal Müller told Edward Pentin in a Sept. 28 interview published in the National Catholic Register.\nIn fact the statement of the Argentine bishops only speaks of the possibility of “access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist.” This could reasonably be interpreted as going to confession before receiving Holy Communion.\n\nThe same applies to statements of Pope Francis and Cardinal Schoenborn mentioned by Ferrara.\nPope Francis defers to the exposition of Amoris laetitia by Cardinal Schoenborn given in April 2016 when the exhortation was made public.\nI have read the Cardinal's exposition in both Italian and English, and I only find mention of the help of the sacraments in certain cases.\nOnce again, Mr. Ferrara assumes this means access to Holy Communion without prior sacramental confession.\nWith regard to the letter thanking the Bishops of Malta, it should be noted that Edward Pentin mentions a letter of Cardinal Baldiserri not a letter of Pope Francis.\nMoreover, this letter has not been made public so we don't know exactly what it says other than an expression of thanks.\nThis seems to be very thin evidence for claiming Pope Francis wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers to the sacraments while continuing in their adulterous relations.\nAs a lawyer, Ferrara should have a better sense of what really counts as evidence.\nAs a Christian, he should also be mindful of the command against bearing false witness.\n\nBeyond these considerations, I wish to express a personal concern I have about Mr. Ferrara's standing in the Catholic Church.\nHe says that Dr. Goldstein and I are “foot soldiers of a Leviathan Church” because we defend the Roman Pontiff.\nDoes Mr. Ferrara believe that the Catholic Church under Pope Francis is a “Leviathan Church” and not the Catholic Church?\nIf this is so, then it would suggest that Mr. Ferrara is refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff and communion with the members of the Church subject to him.\nThis, though, is the very definition of schism found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2089 and the 1983 CIC canon 751.\nI hope Mr. Ferrara can clarify what he means by the “Leviathan Church” under Pope Francis.\nA more simple question to him would be this: “Are you refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff or communion with the members subject to him?”\n\nI apologize ahead of time if I misconstrued his words.\nI believe, though, my question is reasonable in light of his reference to a “Leviathan Church” distinct from “the dictates of the Immortal God in heaven.”\n\nChris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 9 hours ago\n\nIf Dr. Fastiggi wishes to continue to pretend, despite a growing mountain of evidence, that Pope Francis has not in fact approved of the admission of public adulterers to Holy Communion--just as he did when Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and just as he did with the woman he telephoned in Argentina—then I cannot help him.\n\nAs for my metaphorical reference to a “Leviathan Church,” I am afraid Dr. Fastiggi has succumbed to an unfortunate literal-mindedness.\nTo make it clear for him, I am contending that he and his co-author treat the Pope as if he were the absolute ruler of Hobbes’s Leviathan.\nI do not, as should be obvious, argue that this Leviathan Church actually exists.\nThat it does not and cannot exist is precisely my point.\n\nDr. Fastiggi’s inapt citation to Canon 751 and his clumsy and insulting questions about my “standing in the Catholic Church” and whether I am “refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff” demonstrate a pronounced lack of comprehension of pertinent ecclesiological and theological basics, and a rather embarrassing lack of rhetorical finesse.\nRaising objections to a papal document because it appears to depart from sound orthodoxy is hardly “refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff,” who has not, at any rate, actually commanded anyone to “submit” to anything via AL.\n\nI respectfully suggest that Dr. Fastiggi’s comments evince a need for serious study and reflection before he ventures further opinions on this controversy in public.\n\nEditor’s Note: Paragraph breaks added for readability.\n>","completion":"

Bush administration.\nAs for her ties with Goldman Sachs, Breitbart reported the following:\n1 – When she served as president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Wall Street giant, Powell repeatedly partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative for a globalist women’s project that served as the centerpiece of Goldman’s foundation.\n2 – Powell’s organization joined with the Clinton Global Initiative for globalist giving projects.\n3 – Powell’s Goldman Sachs fund directly donated to the controversial Clinton Foundation.\n4 – Powell’s Goldman Sachs group worked with Hillary Clinton’s State Department in a project announced by Clinton.\n5 – Powell was a featured speaker at a Clinton Global Initiative event alongside Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chief, John Podesta.\n6 – There are crossover connections between employees paid by Powell’s 10,000 Women and the Clintons.\n7 – Powell served on a global group alongside Hillary Clinton.\n8 – In coming to Goldman Sachs, Powell joined a firm that has long been deeply tied to the Clintons.\nDaniel Greenfield wrote about Dina Habib Powell:\n“The media dubbed her the Republican Huma Abedin.\nShe’s been one of the most powerful women in two Republican administrations.\nShe’s friends with Valerie Jarrett….Habib Powell had all the right friends.\nLike Valerie Jarrett.\nArianna Huffington praised the White House for bringing her in.\nHer ex-husband heads up Teneo Strategy: the organization created by the same man who made the Clinton Foundation happen and which employed Huma Abedin.\nYou could see her posing next to Huma, Arianna and a Saudi princess.\nYou can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala.\nThe ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi’s American Committee on Jerusalem.\nKhalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal.\nAnd Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO’s Hanan Ashrawi….Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment.\nHer top role at the NSC represents McMaster’s vision for our approach to Islam.\nAnd it’s an echo of the failed approach of the Bush years.\nFlynn made the NSC into a tool that matched Trump’s vision.\nMcMaster is remaking it to match Jeb Bush’s vision.”\nGreenfield also adds:\nWhen visiting Egypt, Habib-Powell had assured the locals of how Bush, after September 11, “visited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.” “I see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year,” she gushed.\nK.T.\nMcFarland had written that “Global Islamist jihad is at war with all of Western civilization.” It’s not hard to see why McMaster pushed out McFarland and elevated Habib-Powell.\nHabib-Powell had attended the Iftar dinner with members of Muslim Brotherhood front groups.\nYou can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala.\nThe ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi’s American Committee on Jerusalem.\nShe was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by Hanan Ashrawi.\nHer achievements under Bush included cultural exchanges with Iran, as well as cash for the Palestinian Authority and for Lebanon after the Hezbollah war with Israel.\nWhile President Trump fights to restrict Muslim immigration, at his side is the woman who had once bragged on CNN, “Over 90% of student visas are now issued in under a week, and that is in the Middle East.”\nPamela Geller also pointed out why Powell should not be the UN ambassador.\nDina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment.\nShe is part of the swamp, part of the willfully ignorant McMaster crowd that clearly opposed Trump’s agenda.\nBack in 2017, she resigned her post of Deputy National Security Adviser NSC under Islamic apologist H. R. McMaster, whose failed views she shared.\nMcMaster subscribed to the Obama view that Islamic terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, despite the numerous Islamic texts and teachings that incite Muslims to wage war against unbelievers.\nMcMaster went so far as to claim that devout jihadis were “irreligious.” McMaster forced out superb K.T.\nMcFarland from her role as Deputy National Security Advisor and inserted Dina Habib-Powell, former Bush gatekeeper whose pals included Huma Abedin and Valerie Jarrett.\nAgain, and I have asked this before, how do you fight the Deep State by putting Deep State operatives in these positions?\nHow do you drain the swamp by adding to it?\nThe answer is clear: You don't.\nThis would actually be the perfect time for Trump not to appoint an ambassador to the UN and call for the US to exit the anti-American organization and demand Congress stop funding it and evict the UN from US soil, but I'm not holding my breath.\n>","completion":" Flag-Waving|398|407\nSlogans|1974|1989\nLoaded_Language|2968|2974\nLoaded_Language|6673|6691\nRepetition|7500|7505\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|381|407\nDoubt|7357|7478\nDoubt|7479|7522\nFlag-Waving|7676|7689."}
{"prompt":"The Obama Era Jade Helm Connection To The Current Illegal Immigration Policy\n\nOn the surface, the latest illegal immigration debate between Leftists and the Administration looks like, yet another issue Progressives are trying to undermine progress being done by the president.\nNo one should be surprised by the crackdown on illegals entering the country, especially since it was one of the major campaign promises Donald Trump made before getting elected.\nWhen it comes to the separation of children from their families, there is nothing new today that was not being done during the Obama reign.\nIn 2013, Obama began bringing into the US literally over a hundred thousand people, mainly below age 21.\nThey were bused, flown, and met at the US border with Mexico by the Department of Homeland Security under the direction of Obama to do so.\nSince most of them were adolescents and older teenagers they could not be set free, thus Obama ordered various military bases to house these children.\ntake our poll -

{"prompt":"Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges\n\nEditor's Note: This is probably a reason why reporters Laura Loomer and Mike Tokes were barred from entering the presser.\nThey would have posed real genuine questions of Sheriff Lombardo and forced him to stumble all over himself in answering them.\nThe words “conspiracy theorists” are being bandied about.\nAre they for real?\nA well-coordinated, meticulously planned attack on concertgoers leads to the murder of 58 Americans at a country music festival in Las Vegas, with over 500 injured, and they have no explanation or motive.\nDo the FBI and law enforcement think people won’t talk about it or speculate as to what happened?\nAre they for real?\nFurther, the FBI insists there is no jihad motive, while saying they don’t know his motive.\nHow can they possibly hold those two contradictory ideas at the same time?\nThe sheriff, alluding to allegations of a conspiracy between his department, the F.B.I., and MGM — supposedly in an effort to establish a legal case — said, “there is no conspiracy.”\nWilliam Jacobson explains the latest “revise” by the authorities is the now infamously botched Vegas investigation:\nOctober 13, 2017, Legal Insurrection\n\nPolice and hotel still don’t agree on some details.\nI realize that in the heat of a shooting, particularly a mass shooting, it may take some time for a precise timeline to develop.\nBut it didn’t take very long for the Las Vegas police to release a precise timeline.\nThe initial timeline was that Stephen Paddock’s shooting stopped when, approximately 6 minutes after he started, he was interrupted by a security guard from the Mandalay Bay hotel.\nPaddock then turned his fire into the hallway, firing some 200 bullets, and after that the shooting stopped as police arrived.\nThat was Version No.\n1.\nSome days later, the Las Vegas police backed away from that timeline, and stated that the security guard actually arrived 6 minutes before Paddock started shooting into the crowd 32 stories below him.\nThat raised a number of question, including why no one called 911 after what must have been a loud volley of shots in a hotel hallway.\nThat was Version No.\n2.\nBut now that is disputed, in Version No.\n3.\nWaPo reports:\nLas Vegas police said Friday that the gunman who opened fire on a country music festival far below his hotel suite did not shoot a security guard six minutes before that rampage, contradicting a timeline they had offered earlier this week….\nThe confusion began Monday when police said that the gunman fired at the hotel security guard, Jesus Campos, six minutes before the mass shooting began, not during the massacre as they had said.\nLombardo also said police had hunted for the source of the gunfire and that officers responding to the gunman’s floor were unaware that a guard was shot until they arrived there, at which point the shooting rampage had ended.\nMGM Resorts pushed back on this account, first saying Tuesday that there were unspecified inaccuracies and then, on Thursday, releasing a statement directly contradicting parts of what the police had said….\nLombardo had said Monday that Campos, the guard, was shot at 9:59 p.m. and that the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m.\nThis six-minute gap relayed by Lombardo left uncertain whether there was any lag in alerting police to the source of the gunfire during critical moments.\nPolice said officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m., two minutes after Paddock had stopped firing.\nMGM, though, said it was “confident” that the 9:59 p.m. time was inaccurate and “was derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have.” The company also disputed the suggestion of a lag, saying the shooting rampage began within a minute of Campos reporting his injury on the 32nd floor.\nOn Friday, Lombardo effectively agreed with the company’s statement, though he argued that the 9:59 p.m. time he had offered four days earlier “wasn’t inaccurate when I provided it.” Lombardo said he was told this time had been written by someone in a security log.\nUpon investigation, Lombardo said, police learned that Campos first encountered a barricaded door on the 32nd floor at 9:59 p.m.\nThe guard was eventually fired upon by Paddock “in close proximity to” 10:05 p.m., when the mass shooting began, Lombardo continued.\nClear, right?\nNot so fast, the police and hotel still have disagreement over important details, such as when police arrived relative to Paddock’s shooting at the crowd: An enormous, important discrepancy has emerged over what happened during the Las Vegas massacre: When did police arrive on the 32nd floor where Stephen Paddock was firing his deadly fusillade onto concertgoers below?\nLas Vegas police say they didn’t get to the floor until after the shooting was over.\nBut MGM Resorts International, the owner of Mandalay Bay, says police officers were there shortly after the shooting began, responding to a report of a security guard being shot.\nThe discrepancy could raise questions about whether police might have taken steps to intervene while Paddock was launching his devastating 10-minute onslaught….\n… on Thursday, in response to inquiries about when Mandalay Bay notified police of the Campos shooting, MGM Resorts issued a statement that was unequivocal: Las Vegas police officers accompanied Mandalay Bay security to the Campos shooting and “immediately responded.” MGM said that “Metro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio.\nThese Metro officers and armed Mandalay Bay security officers immediately responded to the 32nd floor.” The statement says MGM believes Paddock began firing out the window of his room within 40 seconds of Campos reporting his shooting, and Lombardo said Friday, “I agree with the

{"prompt":"Uranium One Informant Breaks Silence: Moscow Paid Millions To Influence Hillary Clinton\n\nThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n-Article 2, Section 4 of the US Constitution\nRight off the bat, this appears to be clear bribery, and a case could be made for treason.\nHowever, it is now being reported that an FBI informant that was involved in the Uranium One deal, has told congressional committees that Moscow paid lobbyists to influence then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by helping former President Bill Clinton’s charities during the Obama administration.\nThe Hill's John Solomon reported on Wednesday:\nThe informant, Douglas Campbell, said in the statement obtained by The Hill that he was told by Russian nuclear executives that Moscow had hired the American lobbying firm APCO Worldwide specifically because it was in position to influence the Obama administration, and more specifically Hillary Clinton.\n... Campbell added in the testimony that Russian nuclear officials “told me at various times that they expected APCO to apply a portion of the $3 million annual lobbying fee it was receiving from the Russians to provide in-kind support for the Clintons' Global Initiative.\"\n“The contract called for four payments of $750,000 over twelve months.\nAPCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from Uranium One to the U.S.-Russia Civilian Nuclear Cooperation agreement.\"\nAPCO officials told The Hill that its support for the Clinton Global Initiative and its work with Russia were not connected in any way, and in fact involved different divisions of the firm.\nThey added their lobbying for Russia did not involve Uranium One but rather focused on regulatory issues aimed at helping Russia better compete for nuclear fuel contracts inside the United States.\nIn case you are unfamiliar with Uranium One, it is a Canadian mining company whose sale to a Russian firm was approved in 2010.\nThe sale gave the Russians control of part of the US uranium supply, thus why I reference a case could be made for treason.\nWhile Democrats have unsurprisingly questioned Campbell's credibility, Campbell's attorney Victoria Toensing told Sean Hannity, “[The Russians] were so confident that they told Mr. Campbell with the Clinton’s help, it was a shoo-in to get CFIUS [The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] approval.\nThey were so confident in that that they even had him open up the new office because they were planning on the kind of business they were going to do as soon as CFIUS approved it.”\nIn a lengthy report by Award-winning National Security\/War Correspondent Sara Carter, she pointed out that following:\nOn Wednesday, he shared with the committee information he provided to the FBI and has in the past described his frustration with the Obama administration’s failure to stop Russia’s nuclear giant from purchasing 20 percent of American uranium mining assets.\nCampbell testified before numerous Congressional investigators that his extensive counterintelligence work on Russia and stated that during his time as an informant, he obtained information that Russia was continuing to aid the Iranian government.\nAccording to Campbell Russia provided the resources necessary for the nation’s nuclear reactors, despite promises that they were not sharing such technology with Iran.\nIn an April 16, 2010, summary brief provided to his former FBI handlers and obtained by this reporter, he stressed his deep concerns about Tenex, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian state nuclear arm Rosatom and its ongoing work to provide Iran with the technology needed for its nuclear reactor program.\nAt the time, Rosatom was seeking the approval to purchase the Canadian mining company Uranium One.\n“TENEX continues to supply Iran with fuel through their Russian company TVEL,” stated Campbell in a 2010 brief provided to the FBI.\nTVEL is a Russian nuclear fuel cycle company headquartered in Moscow.\n“They (TVEL) continue to assist with construction consult and fabricated assemblies to supply the reactor.\nFabricated assemblies require sophisticated engineering and are arranged inside the reactor with the help and consult of TVEL.” Campbell informed the FBI of the close relationship between TVEL and TENEX, both a part of the Rosatom group.\nHe stated in his brief that while spending time with the Russian executives from both Rosatom and Tenex, that any mention of “TVEL is a subject that is serious to all when mentioned.\nI do not even raise the subject of TVEL to our friends, but occasionally they speak of it and always in a guarded manner.” In the briefs, he informed the FBI that “occasionally someone will mention having been in Iran but usually it is long after the fact.” And when he asked the Russians about these connections, he stated that they “occasionally speak of the relationship, i.e.\nequipment, consulting.\nI asked Vadim (Mikerin) if they felt there was a serious problem, and would they adhere to sanctions and western opinion.\nHis response was a smile and shoulder shrug.” But Campbell had provided the FBI with evidence of the criminal network and delivered the information to the FBI, which was monitoring his work as an informant and approving his transfer of bribery money to the Russians.\nThose transfers, which were made in bulk $50,000 sums and at times delivered in cash, occurred between senior executives of the American transportation company and the Russian executives connected to Rosatom.\nHe had given the FBI irrefutable evidence showing how contracts obtained from the same Russian energy company Tenex, were based on contract bribery and other nefarious actions, he said.\nSenior members of the FBI, Department of Treasury, Department of Energy and Department of Justice were also briefed on Campbell’s information and were apprised of the various facets pertaining to Russia’s acquisition of the Canadian company.\nIn fact, Campbell had been told by his FBI handlers that his work had made it at least twice into President Obama’s classified presidential daily briefings.\nOf course, we know what Obama did with his daily briefings.\nThey are somewhere in the White House sewer system.\nCampbell's work has resulted in real justice being administered.\nIn January, I reported:\nOn Friday, the Justice Department unsealed an 11-count indictment concerning the Uranium One scandal.\nSadly, it did not include former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but rather former DoD intelligence analyst-turned uranium transportation executive Mark Lambert of Mount Airy, Maryland.\nLambert, 54, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering.\nThe charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.\nAccording to the DOJ: According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at “Transportation Corporation A” to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX.\nIn order to effectuate and conceal the corrupt and fraudulent bribe payments, Lambert and others allegedly caused fake invoices to be prepared, purportedly from TENEX to Transportation Corporation A, that described services that were never provided, and then Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia, Cyprus and Switzerland.\nLambert and others also allegedly used code words like “lucky figures,” “LF,” “lucky numbers,” and “cake” to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account.\nThe indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation A’s services.\nIn June 2015, Lambert’s former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA.\nMikerin is currently serving a sentence of 48 months in prison and Condrey is awaiting sentencing.\nThe indictment includes allegations against Lambert based on his role in effectuating the criminal scheme with Condrey, Mikerin, and others.\nWe also know the following about Campbell:\nUndercover FBI informant William Campbell has given written testimony to Congressional investigators after an \"iron clad\" gag order was lifted in October\nCampbell was a highly valued CIA and FBI asset deeply embedded in the Russian nuclear industry while Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI\nwhile Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI Campbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money - which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian \"nuclear money laundering apparatus \"\n\" He collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period, some of which detail efforts by Moscow to route money to the Clinton Foundation\nCampbell claims to have video evidence of bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.\nof bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.\nThe Obama FBI knew about the bribery scheme, yet the administration still approved the Uranium One deal.\nTo thank him for his service, Campbell was paid $51,000 by FBI officials at a 2016 celebration dinner in Chrystal City\nWhen it emerged that Campbell had evidence against the Clinton Foundation, a Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff (of FISA warrant application fame) slammed Campbell as a \"disaster\" potential witness\nAll of this then goes back to things we have pointed out with ranchers in the western united States and how this impacts them, as well as the land grabs that are unconstitutionally orchestrated by the DC government and the Bureau of Land Management.\nThere is also substantial documentation that was discovered in Oregon that relates to this deal during the Oregon occupation in 2016, which got zero coverage in the mainstream media.\nAre we about to see a serious shakedown in all of this?\nTime will tell, but I remain skeptical, as in the end, all we ever get is excuses rather than justice.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith\n\nNewsCatholic Church, Family, Marriage\nROME, February 2, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) —His Excellency Marian Eleganti, auxiliary bishop of Chur in Switzerland, today added his name to the “Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage,” bringing the total number of signatories to eight bishops and one cardinal, LifeSite has confirmed.\nBishop Eleganti’s support of the profession comes just three days after Bishop Athanasius Schneider, auxiliary of Astana, Kazakstan, invited the world’s bishops to sign the document and join in raising a common voice in defense of the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage.\n“God decides the time, and the time will come when the Pope and the episcopacy again will proclaim, with all clarity, unambiguity and beauty, the sanctity of marriage, and of the family, and of the Eucharist,” Schneider told LifesiteNews in an exclusive Jan. 15 interview.\nRaising a Common Voice\nIn conversation with LifeSiteNews, Schneider said greater public support of the document from the world’s 5,000 bishops would be “a stronger voice for professing the constant truths of the Church, and it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.”\nThe Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage was issued by three Kazakh Ordinaries, including Bishop Schneider, in early January.\nIn the document, the three bishops solemnly professed the Church’s received teaching and discipline regarding sacramental marriage and the limited conditions (see Familiaris Consortio, n. 84) under which Catholics who are divorced and “remarried” may receive sacramental absolution and Holy Communion.\nThey presented their profession “before God who will judge us,” in response to certain pastoral norms issued by several bishops’ conferences aimed at implementing chapter 8 of Pope Francis’ apostolic exhortation on the family, Amoris Laetitia.\nSome of these norms, Schneider told LifeSiteNews, give “implicit approval” of divorce and of sexual activity outside a valid marriage.\nSuch a reading is causing “rampant confusion,” will spread “a plague of divorce” in the Church, and is “alien” to the Church’s entire faith and Tradition, the three bishops said in the profession.\n“This is contrary to Divine Revelation,” Schneider further told LifeSite, adding that the “beautiful explanations” that are being presented to clergy and faithful as “discernment” and “pastoral accompaniment,” or a “change of paradigm” and “discovery of the subjective part of the truth,” when translated into “common sense language,” are tantamount to an allowance to sin.\n“Our conscience as bishops calls to us to do this,” Schneider explained.\n“We were forced by our conscience, in the conscience of the Successors of the Apostles and colleagues of the Pope.”\nAs Successors of the Apostles, Schneider said they “could not act in another way.”\nBishop Marian Eleganti\nThe profession’s most recent signatory, Bishop Marian Eleganti, O.S.B., is a monk of the abbey of the Missionary Benedictines in St. Otmarsberg in Uznach, located in the canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland.\nHe was ordained to the priesthood on June 23, 1995.\nIn July 1999, the monks of St. Otmarsberg Abbey (the youngest abbey in Switzerland) elected Eleganti the second abbot of the monastery.\nThe Missionary Benedictines in Uznach belong to the Benedictine Congregation of St. Ottilien near Munich, with branches in Europe, East, West and South Africa, South America, Cuba and the USA, India, Korea, China, Kazakhstan and the Philippines.\nIn 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Abbot Marian Eleganti as auxiliary bishop of the diocese of Chur, Switzerland.\nHe was ordained a bishop on Jan. 31, 2010.\nSince 2011, Bishop Eleganti has served as the Swiss Youth Bishop for German-speaking Switzerland on behalf of the Swiss Bishops’ Conference, and as vicar for religious and monastic communities.\nHe is also the vicar for the philosophical-theological education and ongoing formation and training of pastoral workers.\nBishop Marian Eleganti’s public support of the Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage brings the number of signatories to nine.\nTo date, in addition to the three original signatories from Kazakstan, the following prelates have signed the profession: Cardinal Janis Pujats, Emeritus Archbishop Metropolitan of Riga, Latvia; Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, former apostolic nuncio to the United States; His Excellency Luigi Negri, Archbishop emeritus of Ferrara-Comacchio, Italy; Bishop Andreas Laun, Emeritus Auxiliary of Salzburg, Austria;

Julian Assange Best Price: $3.04 Buy New $9.55 (as of 06:45 EDT - Details)\nIn a letter to the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, Julian’s father, John Shipton, wrote: “I ask the prime minister to do all within his power to return Julian home before Julian’s situation becomes an irreversible tragedy.” That is why this is such an urgent case of justice toward a single human being as well as a case of a journalistic organization’s right to function and our right to have the information it provides.\nOnly seven years ago, the current prime minister said that when an Australian citizen is threatened in this way the prime minister should respond.\nThat was Turnbull before he became prime minister.\nNow the government is playing its usual role of being the fifty-first state of the United States.\nIt is a true disgrace.\nRC: What about Theresa May and the British government?\nAre they getting pressure from the United States or are there internal reasons why they want to keep Julian Assange quiet?\nJP: Everything comes down to the relationship with the United States.\nAustralia has an almost totally servile relationship with America, in which its national security structure, much of its academic life and certainly much of its media is integrated into the US system.\nThat is not entirely the case in Britain.\nSince the loss of its empire after the Second World War, Britain has been eager to play a secondary role to the new imperial power.\nIn many parts of the world, Britain is still the biggest corporate investor.\nBut it does move in lockstep with the US on much of its foreign policy.\nIt is interesting to see the corruption that this kind of relationship produces.\nInformation has come out that the Crown Prosecution Service tried to prevent the Swedes from giving up the case against Julian on bogus sexual assault charges.\nThe pressure was on from London to keep it going.\nJulian is also seen as defying a system and that is just not acceptable.\nThere is a real element of vindictiveness here.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service kept this case going when otherwise the European warrant put out by the Swedes would have been abandoned in 2013.\nWhen Julian came up to a bail hearing last year, it was an absolute disgrace.\nThe judge described Julian’s circumstances as if he were on some sort of extended vacation.\nWhat didn’t emerge was the whole conflict of interest in this hearing.\nThe judge’s husband is a figure deep within the national security establishment in Britain who was named in WikiLeaks documents.\nBecause there is no serious media examining the whole WikiLeaks witch hunt, virtually none of this emerges.\nDB: The corporate press has a major responsibility if Julian Assange goes down, don’t you agree?\nJP: As you know, Dennis, governments do respond to pressure from powerful media interests.\nIt rarely happens but when it does governments do change their tune.\nThere has been no pressure from media in the United States, Britain, Australia or pretty much anywhere except in programs like yours outside the mainstream.\nYou are absolutely right in that the responsibility of journalists for what has happened to Julian Assange and what might happen to WikiLeaks is undeniable.\nI was looking this morning at a report by Media Lens in Britain describing how the British press has reported on Julian Assange.\nIt describes the tsunami of vindictive personal abuse that has been heaped upon Julian from well-known journalists, many claiming liberal credentials.\nThe Guardian, which used to consider itself the most enlightened newspaper in the country, has probably been the worst.\nThe frontal attacks have been coming not from governments but from journalists.\nI described this recently as “Vichy journalism,” a term which now fits so much of the mainstream media.\nIt collaborates in the same way that the Vichy government in France collaborated with the Nazis.\nThe WikiLeaks Files: T...

{"prompt":"Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter\n\nThanks to crackpots online, a Mesa man has become embroiled in conspiracy theories after he sold ammunition to the Las Vegas mass shooter.\nDouglas Haig, a 55-year-old Honeywell engineer, sold more than 700 rounds of ammunition to Las Vegas mass murderer Stephen Paddock in September.\nHaig's name was inadvertently revealed this week when unredacted court documents were released to reporters.\nSearch warrant records showed that Haig was a person of interest in the investigation of the mass shooting.\nAs a result, Haig said that he has received death threats and people have pounded on his door to tell him that he deserves to die.\n\"It makes me feel horrible,\" he said at a news conference Friday morning.\n\"People need to do their research and think rather than just react viscerally.”\nIt's not just people harassing Haig at his home: Conspiracy theorists online have seized on Haig's engineering background to lob wild claims about the Las Vegas shooting.\nMany of their theories lean heavily on Haig's LinkedIn profile, which says that Haig previously worked for Boeing and Northrop Grumman.\nBonkers conspiracy site Intellihub posted an article this week that pointed to Haig's background in the aerospace industry as a sign of U.S. government involvement in the massacre.\nThey noted Haig's LinkedIn page, which says he worked for Boeing in Mesa as a senior liaison engineer in their unmanned helicopter division from 2010 to 2013.\n\"Let’s not forget that it is a fact that helicopters were lurking behind the Mandalay Bay during the attack which were not shown on the radar,\" author Shepard Ambellas writes.\nAmbellas claims helicopters provided an \"air assault\" during the massacre, a ludicrous theory he's expounded upon on InfoWars with the internet's conspiracy-theorist-in-chief Alex Jones.\nAmbellas and Intellihub claim that the FBI and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department are providing cover for the real story behind the massacre, with help from Haig.\nIn public statements this week, Haig denied any connection to the massacre and said he merely sold Paddock the rounds.\n\"However, don’t be fooled,\" Intellihub writes.\n\"Haig is likely a CIA cut-out who is just upholding the public narrative in conjunction with the FBI Las Vegas and the LVMPD.\"\nLaura Loomer, a noxious far-right personality who formerly worked for Project Veritas, also started making hay with Haig's background in Arizona aerospace.\nShe wrote on Twitter that the massacre \"is starting to look more and more like a gun running operation gone wrong every day.\"\nDouglas Haig’s @LinkedIn Account says he also has “DOD Top secret clearance” on top of specializing in military ammunition.\n\nHe is the second suspect in the #LasVegasShooting.\n\nThis is starting to look more and more like a gun running operation gone wrong every day.\npic.twitter.com\/ifkkglZ4kw — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) January 30, 2018\nBut Haig is an engineer, and he says he's not a former military officer.\nIt should be noted that Haig's rounds were probably not even used in the massacre: Haig sold Paddock tracer ammunition, which emit a flare when fired making them easier to see.\nHad Paddock fired these rounds during the nighttime massacre at the concert, they would have been visible.\nHaig's attorney Marc Victor told reporters it was perfectly legal for Haig, a private citizen, to sell Paddock hundreds of rounds of tracer ammunition — the bullets are legal in Arizona.\nPaddock showed up to buy ammunition at Haig's home after meeting him at a gun show in Phoenix.\n\"I sold him 600 rounds of .308 tracer, surplus U.S. military.\nI sold him 120 rounds of .556 tracer, again, surplus U.S. military,\" Haig said to ABC15.\n\"I put it in a box for him.\nHe paid me, put it in his car, and left.\"\nHaig said he's been legally selling ammunition as as a hobby since 1991, but after the massacre, he has stopped his side business.\nIt wasn't unusual for a customer to buy over 700 rounds, he said.\n\"I've seen all kinds of people.\nThere were no tells,\" Haig said of Paddock.\nWhen asked about the threats, Haig said, “I’ve had people screaming they want me to die through my front door.\"\nHaig and his attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the conspiracy theorizing.\nHaig said he's sorry that the massacre took place, but emphasized that he had nothing to do with Paddock's mass shooting.\n“I had no contribution to what Paddock did,” Haig said at the news conference.\n“I had no way to see into his mind.\nThe product that I sold him had absolutely nothing to do with what he did.”\nNevertheless, it's hard to believe that Haig's denials will dissuade the conspiracy-mongers.\nYouTube conspiracy theorist Jake Morphonios said that for all he knows, Doug Haig didn't play a role in Paddock's massacre.\nEven so, Morphonious still parlayed an innocent-until-proven-guilty stance into a 30-minute dissertation where he discussed a \"shadow government in the United States\" in the context of Haig's work for companies like Northrop Grumman.\n\"Did he know something that Stephen Paddock was going to do?\nThat I don't know — it's possible, but who knows.\"\nMorphonious said.\nHe added, \"I've got some questions of my own about Doug Haig that I'm going to continue seeking answers for.\"\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted\n\nNovember 29, 2018\nThis Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted\nIn 2015 the British Guardian appointed Katherine Viner as editor in chief.\nUnder her lead the paper took a new direction.\nWhile it earlier made attempts to balance its shoddier side with some interesting reporting, it is now solidly main stream in the worst sense.\nIt promotes neo-liberalism and a delves into cranky identity grievances stories.\nIt also became an main outlet for manipulative propaganda peddled by the British secret services.\nIts recent fake news story about Paul Manafort, Wikileaks and Julian Assange aptly demonstrates this.\nThe documentation of it is a bit lengthy but provides that it was a willful fake.\nOn November 27 the Guardian prepared to publish a story which asserted that Paula Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, had met Julian Assange, the publisher of Wikileaks, in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on at least three occasions.\nSome two hours before the story went public it contacted Manafort and Assange's lawyers to get their comments.\nAssange's Wikileaks responded through its public Twitter account which has 5.4 million followers.\nOn of those followers is Katherine Viner:\nWikiLeaks @wikileaks - 13:06 utc - 27 Nov 2018 SCOOP: In letter today to Assange's lawyers, Guardian's Luke Harding, winner of Private Eye's Plagiarist of the Year, falsely claims jailed former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had secret meetings with Assange in 2013, 2015 and 2016 in story Guardian are \"planning to run\".\nIt attached the email the Guardian's Luke Harding had send.\n90 minutes later the Guardian piece went life.\nIt led the front page and also appeared in print.\nThe first version read:\nManafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret talks with Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and visited around the time he joined Trump’s campaign, the Guardian has been told.\nSources have said Manafort went to see Assange in 2013, 2015 and in spring 2016 – during the period when he was made a key figure in Trump’s push for the White House.\nIt is unclear why Manafort wanted to see Assange and what was discussed.\nBut the last meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nA well-placed source has told the Guardian that Manafort went to see Assange around March 2016.\nMonths later WikiLeaks released a stash of Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers.\nManafort, 69, denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is “100% false”.\nHis lawyers declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the visits.\nThe piece did not include the public denial Wikileaks issued to its 5.4 million followers one and a half hour before it was published.\nThe Guardian piece came at a critical moment.\nCurrently the U.K. and Ecuador conspire to deliver Julian Assange to U.S. authorities.\nOn Monday special counsel Robert Mueller said Manafort lied to investigators, violating his recent plea deal.\nThe new sensational claim was immediately picked up by prominent reporters and major main stream outlets.\nThey distributed is as a factual account.\nIt is likely that millions of people took note of its claim.\nBut several people who had followed the Russiagate fairytale and the Mueller investigation were immediately suspicious of the Guardian claim.\nThe story was weakly sourced and included some details that seemed unlikely to be true.\nGlenn Greenwald noted that the Ecuadorian embassy is under heavy CCTV surveillance.\nThere are several guards, and visitors have to provide their identity to enter it.\nEvery visit is logged.\nIf Manafort had really visited Assange, it would have long been known:\nIn sum, the Guardian published a story today that it knew would explode into all sorts of viral benefits for the paper and its reporters even though there are gaping holes and highly sketchy aspects to the story.\nMoreover, the main author of the story, Luke Harding, is known to be a notorious fraud, a russo-phobe intelligence asset with a personal grievance towards Assange and Wikileaks.\nA year ago an important Moon of Alabama piece - From Snowden To Russia-gate - The CIA And The Media - mentioned Harding:\nThe people who promote the \"Russian influence\" nonsense are political operatives or hacks.\nTake for example Luke Harding of the Guardian who just published a book titled Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win.\nHe was taken apart in a Real News interview (vid) about the book.\nThe interviewer pointed out that there is absolutely no evidence in the book to support its claims.\nWhen asked for any proof for his assertion Harding defensively says that he is just \"storytelling\" - in other words: it is fiction.\nHarding earlier wrote a book about Edward Snowden which was a similar sham.\nJulian Assange called it \"a hack job in the purest sense of the term\".\nHarding is also known as plagiarizer.\nWhen he worked in Moscow he copied stories and passages from the now defunct Exile, run by Matt Taibbi and Mark Ames.\nThe Guardian had to publish an apology.\nThe new Guardian story looked like another weak attempt to connect the alleged Russian malfeasance with Assange and the Wikileaks publishing of the DNC emails.\nAssange and other involved people deny that such a relation existed.\nThere is no public evidence that support such claims.\nShortly after the Guardian's fake news story went public Paul Manafort issued an unequivocal denial:\n“I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him,” the statement said.\n“I have never been contacted by anyone connected to Wikileaks, either directly or indirectly.\nI have never reached out to Assange or Wikileaks on any matter.\nWe are considering all legal options against the Guardian who proceeded with this story even after being notified by my representatives that it was false.”\nAt 16:05 utc the Guardian silently edited the story.\nCaveats (here in italic and underlined) were added to the headline and within several paragraphs.\nNo editorial note was attached to inform the readers of the changes:\nManafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy, sources say ...\nIt is unclear why Manafort would have wanted to see Assange and what was discussed.\nBut the last apparent meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n...\nWhy Manafort might have sought out Assange in 2013 is unclear.\n...\nManafort, 69, denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is “100% false”.\nHis lawyers initially declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the visits.\nOne paragraph was added to included Wikileaks' denial:\nIn a series of tweets WikiLeaks said Assange and Manafort had not met.\nAssange described the story as a hoax.\nAt 16:30 utc, under fire from other media and journalists, the Guardian issued a statement:\nThis story relied on a number of sources.\nWe put these allegations to both Paul Manafort and Julian Assange's representatives prior to publication.\nNeither responded to deny the visits taking place.\nWe have since updated the story to reflect their denials.\nThis defensive Guardian claim is, like its story, evidently completely false.\nWikileaks publicly denied the Guardian's claims 90 minutes before the story was first published.\nManafort asserts that his lawyers had notified the Guardian that the story was false before the Guardian 'proceeded with the story'.\nAt 21:05 utc a third version was published which included Manafort's denial.\nHalf an hour later Julian Assange instructed his lawyers to sue the Guardian for libel.\nWikileaks opened a fund to support the lawsuit.\nA day after the Guardian smear piece the Washington Times reported that Manafort's passports, entered into evidence by the Mueller prosecution, show that he did not visit London in any of the years the Guardian claimed he was there to visit Assange.\nThe story was completely false and the Guardian knew it was.\nIt disregarded and left out the denials the subjects of the story had issued before it was published.\n\nThe Guardian has become a main outlet for British government disinformation operations aimed at defaming Russia.\nIt smeared Assange and Snowden as Russian collaborators.\nIt uncritically peddled the Russiagate story and the nonsensical Skripal claims which are both obviously concocted by British intelligence services.\nThat seems to have become its main purpose.\nAs Disobediant Media notes (emphasis in the original):\nWhile most readers with functional critical thinking capacity may readily dismiss the Guardian’s smear on its face, the fact that the Guardian published this piece, and that Luke Harding is still operating with even the tiniest modicum of respect as a journalist despite his history of deceit, tells us something bone-chilling about journalism.\nIt is no accident that Luke Harding is still employed: in fact, it is because of Harding’s consistent loyalty to establishment, specifically the UK intelligence apparatus, over the truth that determines his “success” amongst legacy press outlets.\nHarding is not a defacement or a departure from the norm, but the personification of it.\nJonathan Cook, a former Guardian writer, makes a similar point:\nThe truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange, or in its much longer-running campaign to vilify him.\nWith this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake – it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative.\nIts job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing, neoliberal order: ...\nThe Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence.\nIt did what it is designed to do.\nWe have previously shown that the Guardian even uses fascist propaganda tropes to smear the Russian people.\nIt is openly publishing Goebbels' cartoons and rhetoric against Europes biggest state.\nThere is no longer any line that it does not dare to cross.\nUnfortunately other 'western' media are not much better.\nWithin hours of being published the Guardian piece was debunked as fake news.\nThat did not hinder other outlets to add to its smear.\nPolitico allowed \"a former CIA officer,\" writing under a pen name, to suggest - without any evidence - that the Guardian has been duped - not by its MI5\/6 and Ecuadorian spy sources, but by Russian disinformation:\nRather than being the bombshell smoking gun that directly connects the Trump campaign to WikiLeaks, perhaps the report is something else entirely: a disinformation campaign.\nIs it possible someone planted this story as a means to discredit the journalists?\n...\nHarding is likely a major target for anyone wrapped up in Russia’s intelligence operation against the West’s democratic institutions.\n...\nIf this latest story about Manafort and Assange is false—that is, if, for example, the sources lied to Harding and Collyns (or if the sources themselves were lied to and thus thought they were being truthful in their statements to the journalists), or if the Ecuadorian intelligence document is a fake, the most logical explanation is that it is an attempt to make Harding look bad.\nThe is zero evidence in the Politico screed that supports its suggestions and claims.\nIt is fake news about a fake news story.\nIt also included the false claim that Glenn Greenwald worked with Wikileaks on the Snowden papers.\nThat claim was later removed.\nWe have seen a similar pattern in the Skripal affair.\nWhen 'western' intelligence get caught in spreading disinformation, they accuse Russia of being the source of the fake.\nUnfortunately no western main stream media can any longer be trusted to publish the truth.\nThe Guardian is only one of many which peddle smears and disinformation about the 'enemies' of the ruling 'western interests'.\nIt is on all of us to debunk them and to educate the public about their scheme.\n---\nThis is a Moon of Alabama

{"prompt":"Trump's North Korean gamble ends with 'special bond' with Kim\n\nNearly five hours of unprecedented and surreal talks between US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un culminated on Tuesday with fulsome declarations of a new friendship but just vague pledges of nuclear disarmament.\n\nFor Trump, that amounted to a triumphant outcome in his extraordinary gamble with the rogue kingdom's despotic leader.\nBut there were scant details on what new commitments had been secured from Kim, even as Trump announced he would end the regular military exercises the US conducts with South Korea.\nWhether nuclear disarmament is indeed the final outcome of Tuesday's summit won't be known for years, if not decades.\nBut the dramatic act of extending his hand to one of America's longtime adversaries will forever illustrate Trump's gut-driven, norm-shattering tenure.\n\"We both want to do something.\nWe both are going to do something.\nAnd we have developed a very special bond,\" Trump said at the conclusion of the landmark summit.\n\"People are going to be very impressed.\nPeople are going to be very happy.\"\nThe document he and Kim signed said the North Korean leader \"reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\"\nIn exchange, Trump agreed to \"provide security guarantees\" to North Korea.\nBut there was no mentioning the previous US aim of \"complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.\"\nAnd Kim's commitments did not appear to go beyond what he already pledged to do in April when he met South Korean President Moon Jae-in along their countries' border.\nTrump insisted during a news conference the agreement went further than many people expected.\nBut he acknowledged the effort to rid North Korea of its nuclear arsenal was in its early stages.\n\"We will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done,\" he said.\nMore critical, in Trump's telling, was the development of a personal bond with Kim, a brutal dictator responsible for the deaths not only of his own citizens but of at least one American, Otto Warmbier, who was returned to the US in a coma only to die days later.\n\"I think our whole relationship with North Korea and the Korean Peninsula is going to be a very much different situation than it has in the past,\" Trump said during the summit.\nLater, during his news conference, Trump said Warmbier's death contributed to the summit taking place.\n\"Without Otto, this would not have happened,\" Trump said.\nTrump and Kim -- both intent on making history -- greeted each other early in the day with extended hands in front of a row of US and North Korean flags, a previously unthinkable sight that reflects a new chapter in the two countries' acrimonious relationship.\nTrump's threats to politely walk out of the meeting if his expectations were unmet did not materialize.\nInstead he predicted he could \"solve a big problem, a big dilemma\" alongside his new partner.\n\"Working together, we'll get it taken care of,\" Trump said.\nThe remarks came amid an improbable series of events that few could have anticipated even three months ago.\nThe unlikely images of US and North Korean counterparts engaging in friendly dialogue lent the day an air of unreality.\nIn a detailed menu, the White House said the men were served Häagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream for dessert.\nOther unforeseen events also surrounded the summit, increasing the drama.\nMinutes before the historic handshake, Trump tweeted that his top economic adviser Larry Kudlow had suffered a heart attack.\nImmediately after the encounter, Dennis Rodman -- one of the only Americans to have met Kim -- was openly weeping while being interviewed by CNN's Chris Cuomo.\nEven Kim seemed to acknowledge the surreality of the day.\n\"Many people in the world will think of this as a (inaudible) form of fantasy ... from a science fiction movie,\" his translator was overheard saying as the two leaders walked down a white-columned colonnade.\nAt the conclusion of the summit, Trump hailed the talks as a historic, and personal, achievement.\n\"We learned a lot about each other and our countries,\" Trump said.\n\"I learned he's a very talented man.\"\nWhen pressed about those comments in light of Kim's brutal tactics, Trump continued praising the North Korean leaders' ability to run a country at a young age.\n\"He is very talented,\" Trump said, citing Kim's ability to \"take over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and run it, and run it tough.\"\nKim assumed power after his father Kim Jong Il, also a brutal dictator, died in 2011.\nThroughout the day, Trump and Kim's body language was openly friendly, a striking warmth given Kim's iron grip on power and dismal record on human rights.\nTrump's move to meet him attracted fierce criticism for normalizing a regime routinely called out for its human rights abuses, that over years has built an image of fearsome renegade regime, throwing around threats of nuclear war.\nThe day began with Trump patting Kim on the back and placing his hand on the North Korean's shoulder as they walked into their first meeting.\nLater they were seen smiling and laughing over lunch.\nTrump told reporters he would \"absolutely\" extend an invitation to the White House to Kim, who also heralded a new era.\n\"Today, we had a historic meeting and decided to leave the past behind,\" Kim said through a translator.\n\"The world will see a major change.\"\nThe meeting came only months after the two men traded nuclear taunts, ratcheting up tensions and leading to fears of war.\nBy contrast, Trump appeared to back off a military footing on Tuesday, declaring the US will stop the \"war games,\" an apparent reference to joint military exercises with South Korea that North Korea has long rebuked as provocative.\nTrump also said he hopes to eventually withdraw US forces from South Korea, but said \"that's not part of the equation right now.\"\n\"I want to get our soldiers out.\nI want to bring our soldiers back home,\" Trump said.\n\"But that's not part of the equation right now.\nI hope it will be eventually.\"\nTuesday's meeting, convened at a luxury hotel on the island of Sentosa, came just three months after Trump accepted North Korea's invitation for talks on the spot.\nIt was an extraordinarily compressed timeline for the landmark summit, which at one point was called off entirely as communication broke down between Washington and Pyongyang.\nThe talks were quickly revived, leading to the highly choreographed event that unfolded Tuesday.\nAfter the men shook hands, they repaired inside for one-on-one talks.\nIn that first meeting they were joined only by translators, a break from standard practice of having at least one aide present for high-stakes huddles.\nLater in the day, advisers joined the talks for a larger bilateral session and a working lunch.\nTrump took keen interest in the pageantry of the day, insisting the pictures beamed around the world reflect a commanding leader making a decisive, world-altering move.\nAt the same time, he'd admitted he didn't believe he required extensive preparation to take stock of Kim.\nAs part of the advance work, Trump commissioned a highly produced video meant to convince Kim to relinquish his weapons and open his country to outside investment.\nTrump showed Kim the movie on an iPad during their talks.\nHere in futuristic Singapore, however, Kim was able to view the benefits of economic advancement at close range.\nHe was spotted taking a moonlit stroll around the high-end Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino, owned by GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, the type of glitzy development few North Koreans could ever imagine coming to their country.\nKim was cheered by onlookers who caught sight of the dictator, who until earlier this spring was not believed to have ever left North Korea as supreme leader.\n>","completion":"

{"prompt":"Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia\n\nThis is an outrage, but it is common nationwide: the Daily Caller News Foundation reports that Mountain Ridge Middle School in West Virginia is “instructing junior high students to write the Islamic profession of faith ostensibly to practice calligraphy.” Students are made to write out the Shahada, which states: “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.”This is exactly what I warned about in my book, Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance , in the chapter “The Mosqueing of the Public Schools.”In order to convert to Islam, one says the shahada.\nSaying the shahada makes you a Muslim.\nThe shahada is what is on the black flag of jihad.\nNo non-Muslim student should be forced to write or say the shahada without the qualifier “Muslims believe that…” This is because it is a statement of faith.\nIf the school exercise is requiring students to write it, it should be clear from the wording of the exercise that this is Islamic faith, not the student’s faith.\nThat distinction has been glossed over in many, many school textbook presentations.\nThis is in West Virginia, not Baghdad.\nAnd it’s a problem not just in West Virginia – it’s a national problem.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\n* Dianne Feinstein Maxine Waters Adam Schiff Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand Keith Ellison Cory Booker\nEmail *\nEmail This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nRich Penkoski, the father of a Mountain Ridge student, contacted me and explained the situation further.\nHe sent me the packets the school gave out for the Jewish and the Christian lessons and commented:\nNotice no bible verses, no reciting the 10 commandments or the Lord’s prayer.\nNo practicing writing in Hebrew (not even the 10 commandments) as compared to the Islamic packet.\nThere are no statements of faith, nothing asking the students to write it or practice in any of the Jewish or Christian rituals.\nFurthermore the principal of Mountain Ridge Middle School Dr.\nBranch has used my words against me by saying the teacher did tell the students about the Lord’s prayer (my daughter as well as 1 other said this is false)[.]\nHe is using my arguments I made to him yesterday to protect the teacher.\nThe teacher today told the students the assignment was optional.\nMy daughter as well as other students were under the impression all the packet assignments were mandatory (the Jewish one and the Christian ones were mandatory).\nI wrote to Dr.\nBranch to share with him the resource that Miss Hinson used and point out that the material she gave the students did not include all the faith aspects for Christianity.\nThe students received 2 pages for Christianity from this resource while all the Islamic sections were left intact.\nHere’s the link for you to review.\nYou will notice all the faith elements were left out for Judaism and Christianity while the Islamic section was left the way it’s presented.\nhttps:\/\/www.gvsd.org\/cms\/lib\/PA01001045\/Centricity\/Domain\/610\/World%20Religions.pdf So she decided to use the extra resources for Islam and the school is saying that’s not indoctrination or proselytizing?\nThe faith aspects and the same considerations were not given to the others as they were for Islam.\nThis actually further proves my point that Islam was afforded special privilege over the others.\nThe school is backtracking and being deceptive to try and weasel out of this.\nThe teacher today clarified things for the students but that still does not excuse the fact that they are teaching the Islamic faith and asking the kids to participate in Sharia.\nLook at the Islamic packet again.\nThey are asking the kids to write the beginning of Surahs.\nThe teacher still has not corrected the error that calligraphy was started by the arabs.\nThey are doubling down and only after being called on it are they trying to backtrack.\nRich Penkoski is hardly the first to protest this egregious submission to the most vicious and brutal ideology on the face of the Earth.\nIn Volusia County, Florida, hundreds protested Islamic lessons in their “World History” text, a Common Core-approved high school history textbook.\nWith an entire chapter dedicated to the virtues of Islam and not a single chapter for Christianity, the textbook had Floridians in a frenzy.\nAnd who is the biggest pusher of Common Core besides leftist progressives?\nThe Islamic Society of North America, a Muslim Brotherhood front group, along with the Hamas-tied Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).\nIn Florida, CAIR is on the offensive (more here).\nWe have seen the increasing Islamization of the public-school curriculum.\nHistory lessons in Islam are dawah – proselytizing for Islam.\nLarge public-school publishers have been bought by the Saudis.\nIn West Virginia, it gets even worse.\nRich Penkoski has alerted me to the latest development in the forced Islamization of his children’s school curriculum: after the Daily Caller and Geller Report exposed what was happening, Mountain Ridge administrators and teachers began messaging parents who were sharing the story, asking them to remove their posts.\nWhat do they have to hide?\nApparently, a great deal.\nWorse still, Penkoski is now being threatened by students who attend the school with his daughter.\n(And who is behind them?\nUnidentified “adult friends.”)\nHe sent this message to me:\nA student in the school threatened to get her adult friends to come to my home and kill me by stabbing me in the chest and ripping my organs out.\nThey told my daughter “we are gonna get some people and kill your dad.” This student, who is known to me but whom I cannot name because she is a minor, has given students our address and is encouraging them to come to my home over this whole thing.\nAnother student told my daughter that she and the first student and her adult friends are going to kill me and carve a satanic star in my chest and rip out my organs.\nThey then threatened to hang my 3-year-old and 1-year-old and kidnap my 14-year-old.\nAll this in school today because of the articles.\nThis is not a joke and needs to be investigated.\nI have contacted the school’s principal, Dr.\nBranch, and I trust that he will take this matter seriously and deal with it appropriately.\nIs the principal acting on this?\nAnd do the police have any interest in this?\nOr would that be “islamofauxbic”?\nArticle posted with permission

{"prompt":"MAJOR NEW STUDY: Homeschooling Spikes Due to School Violence, Far-Left Bias\n\nAccording to a 33-year-long study conducted by the National Home Education Research Institute in Oregon, the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment.\nAs reported by The Washington Times, the recent school shooting at Parkland, Fla., was the last straw for scores of parents.\nThe paper noted that “the phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven’t stopped yet.”\nThe Times added:The Lubbock-based organization has been swamped with inquiries for months from parents seeking safer options for their kids in the aftermath of this year’s deadly school massacres, first in Parkland and then in Santa Fe, Texas.\n“When the Parkland shooting happened, our phone calls and emails exploded,” said coalition president Tim Lambert.\n“In the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled.\nWe’re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month, and prior to that it was 600 to 700.”\nWhile the debate rages anew over familiar topics following such tragedies — tougher, more restrictive gun control laws and bolstering security at public schools — the revolution in homeschooling has been taking place quietly, behind the scenes and off the radar screens of most political organizations.\nBut again, it’s not just the shootings, which admittedly have increased in the past couple of years.\nChristopher Chin, head of Homeschool Louisiana, told The Times that parents are fed up with “the violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments.”\nThe Left is driving more kids OUT of public schools\nThere is also the Left-wing social engineering.\nThe craziness over transgender students and bathrooms\/locker rooms, allowing students to “take a knee” during the playing of the National Anthem, the Left-wing curriculum, and refusing to allow students to wear shirts that praise POTUS Trump or feature the American flag are also driving parents into homeschooling.\nREMNANT COMMENT: We here at The Remnant are always eager to promote the home-schooling movement, and this report helps illustrate why.\nAt the moment and personally speaking, my own family’s home-school is going great guns.\nWe have a daughter still in high school and three in grade school.\nOur family couldn't be happier with our decision to homeschool---yes, all the way through high school.\nAnd as for our older home-schooled children: My third-eldest child is preparing to head off to college in the fall.\nHer older sister just finished a semester studying in Austria and will graduate with a double major and a minor degree next spring.\nMy son will be a junior this fall, working on a Mass Communications degree at Franciscan University.\nHere's an example of his work:\nPerhaps this video from a couple of years ago will be useful to those considering home-schooling this fall:\nFriends, please give serious thought and prayer to home-schooling your children.\nI realize it’s a challenge, but few challenges have greater payoffs in this world or the next.\nThere is no better way to keep the Catholic family together and committed to the Catholic restoration than the Catholic home school.\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|843|866\nLoaded_Language|45|60\nLoaded_Language|1705|1713\nLoaded_Language|1719|1727\nLoaded_Language|1859|1868\nLoaded_Language|727|734\nLoaded_Language|1371|1381\nRepetition|478|493\nRepetition|934|942\nRepetition|1536|1545\nRepetition|3309|3317\nRepetition|3339|3347\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|3228|3359\nName_Calling,Labeling|1825|1853\nSlogans|3254|3287\nExaggeration,Minimisation|980|988\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2472|2491."}

Trump for the area, declaring him a “bigot”.\nThe council has been at the centre of serious corruption scandals, including the removal of an Islamist mayor who was found guilty of bribing Muslim groups and wielding “undue spiritual influence” on Muslim voters.\nThe anti-Trump motion, proposed by Councillor Ohid Ahmed and Councillor Oliur Rahman, passed by a majority vote this week.\nIt calls for President Trump’s planned state visit to the United Kingdom to be cancelled, adding: “Should the Government still choose to go ahead with State Visit, this Council makes clear that President Trump would not be welcome in our Borough.” The area in East London includes the famous Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf, but the ban does not appear to be enforceable.\nThe current Labour mayor, John Biggs, complained that President Trump “doesn’t applaud diversity [and] doesn’t respect the culture of others and doesn’t respect women”.\nThe mayor added: “He is failing in his leadership and we should not welcome him here.\nWe must be vigorous in our intolerance of his intolerance.” In response to the news, Peter Golds, the leader of the Conservatives group in the council, tweeted: “In 2015 one of the Tower Hamlets First election candidates tweeted ‘let us support Hitler the Great.’ These people, corruptly elected, have no shame.\nFor the record, our group refused to vote in this farce.” “Tower Hamlets is home to one of the country’s most diverse communities,” the motion begins, adding that it “has the highest percentage of Muslim residents in England – 35 per cent compared with the national average of 5 per cent”.\nAfter several paragraphs of platitudes about “community cohesion” and “diversity”, it says “this Council notes with shock and alarm the decision by Donald Trump, President of the United States, to ‘retweet’ Islamophobic propaganda from the Britain First Twitter account”.\nIt also bemoans that he has allegedly “bigoted attitude towards women, ethnic minorities and Muslims which has resulted in examples of division and hatred within the USA and beyond” and attacks his “illogical” decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\nThe motion also notes that the neighbouring Royal Borough of Greenwich formally adopted a similar motion in December last year….\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n>","completion":" Name_Calling,Labeling|3015|3031\nExaggeration,Minimisation|118|137\nLoaded_Language|189|228\nExaggeration,Minimisation|459|515\nBlack-and-White_Fallacy|918|1208\nName_Calling,Labeling|1223|1265\nLoaded_Language|2585|2611\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|2770|2829\nExaggeration,Minimisation|3015|3033\nLoaded_Language|3048|3065\nLoaded_Language|3579|3602\nLoaded_Language|3665|3744\nBandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum|3912|4039\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|517|629\nLoaded_Language|319|349\nAppeal_to_fear-prejudice|918|1206\nLoaded_Language|1223|1254\nName_Calling,Labeling|1799|1804\nAppeal_to_Authority|2702|2827\nLoaded_Language|3488|3503."}

Xavier Becerra, was secretly copied by authorities after the House Inspector General (IG) identified suspicious activity on it, but the Awans’ physical access was not blocked.\nBut after, the report reads, the server appears to have been secretly replaced with one that looked similar.\nThe memo called for firing the Pakistani-born aides, revoking all their computer accounts, and changing the locks on any door they had access to.\nRep. Louie Gohmert — a Texas Republican on the House Committee on the Judiciary who has done oversight work on the case — said the missing server contained copies of Congress members’ emails.\n“They put 40 members of Congress’s data on one server … That server, with that serial number, has disappeared,” he said.\nMultiple sources connected to the investigation told TheDCNF that shortly after an IG report came out identifying the House Democratic Caucus server as key evidence in a criminal probe, the evidence was stolen.\n“They [the Awans] deliberately turned over a fake server” to falsify evidence, one official close to the CHA alleged.\n“It was a breach.\nThe data was completely out of [members’] possession.”\nThe six-page letter says:\n• In September of 2016 … the CHA and [IG] briefed the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus about suspicious activity related to their server that the [IG] identified.\nAs a result, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus directed the CAO to copy the data from their server and two computers.\n• The CHA directed the IG to refer the matter to the US Capitol Police.\nThe USCP initiated an investigation that continues to this day.\n• In late 2016, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus announced his intention to resign from Congress to assume a new position.\nThe CAO and [sergeant-at-arms] worked with the Chairman to account for his inventory, including the one server.\n• While reviewing the inventory, the CAO discovered that the serial number of the server did not match that of the one imaged in September.\n[Investigators] also discovered that the server in question [the replacement server] was still operating under the employee’s control, contrary to the explicit instructions of the former chairman to turn over all equipment and fully cooperate with the inquiry and investigation.\n[A House source said the \"employee” was Abid Awan.]\n• The USCP interviewed relevant staff regarding the missing server.\n• On January 24, 2017, the CAO acquired the [r[replacement]erver from the control of the employees and transferred that server to the USCP.\nPresident Donald Trump referenced the Democratic Caucus’ missing server in a tweet.\nBut because the letter to the CHA was kept secret, many news outlets have not grasped that the House’s top cop documented a “missing server” connected to the Democratic Caucus.\nThe timeline laid out in the letter also shows that Becerra — now California’s Democratic attorney general — failed to ensure that the Awans didn’t have access to House computer systems during the 2016 election, which was wrought with cybersecurity scandals.\nAn IG presentation from September 2016 shows that Becerra knew of problems months before the server disappeared.\n“The Caucus Chief of Staff requested one of the shared employees to not provide IT services or access their computers,” it read.\n“This shared employee continued.” It’s unclear why that request was not granted or why it was a request rather than an order.\nA House official close to the probe said the employee was Abid, who was not on Becerra or the Caucus’s payroll.\nThe official said Becerra Chief of Staff Sean McCluskie apparently knew Abid was accessing Caucus servers.\nAccording to payroll records, Abid’s sister-in-law, Hina Alvi, was the Caucus’ systems administrator.\nThe Awans’ continued physical access to Becerra’s equipment after red flags emerged enabled the server to disappear after it became evidence, House officials close to the investigation told TheDCNF.\n(RELATED: Becerra Tried To Block Awan From House Democratic Caucus Server, But Logins Continued; He Didn’t Go To Cops)\nBecerra has refused to comment, citing an ongoing criminal investigation.\nThe February 2017 memo itemizes “numerous and egregious violations of House IT security” by members of the Awan family, including using Congress members’ usernames and “the unauthorized storage of sensitive House information outside the House.”\n“These employees accessed user accounts and computers for offices that did not employ them, without the knowledge and permission of the impacted Member’s office,” it said, adding, “4 of the employees accessed the Democratic Caucus computers 5,735 times.” More than 100 office computers were open to access from people not on the office’s staff, it said.\nChris Gowen — a former aide to Hillary Clinton who is now serving as Imran’s attorney — told TheDCNF, “There is no missing server and never was.”\nHe didn’t provide any support for his claim, which is contrary to evidence Kiko and Irving presented to Congress.\nThe memo said the CHA possesses voluminous evidence, including, “Interview notes with House Members’ Chiefs of Staff,” and “Logon activity and computer access logs.” Prosecutors have not brought charges.\nThe Awans were banned from Congress’s computer network the day the letter was sent, and Kiko held a briefing to convey the message to chiefs of staff for members who employed them.\nBut Democrats claim they were never told about any of the cybersecurity issues itemized in the urgent memo.\nRep. Jackie Speier — a California Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who employed Imran and his wife, Hina Alvi — said she never heard of any missing server.\nJoaquin Castro of Texas — another Democratic intelligence committee member who employed one of the Awans — told TheDCNF that Kiko never told him of any cybersecurity issues whatsoever and that the Awan probe was instead described as a theft issue.\nIndeed, the CHA issued only one public statement on the case and titled it the “House Theft Investigation” — wording that avoids cybersecurity words while political news coverage raged about other cybersecurity issues in the 2016 election.\nYet even the alleged theft has not resulted in criminal charges — even though the letter also says House authorities have “purchase orders and vouchers” that allegedly show procurement fraud, as well as testimony from a Democratic chief of staff to Rep. Yvette Clarke, who warned of procurement fraud.\nThe FBI arrested Imran at the airport in July 2017 for alleged bank fraud that occurred six months prior, and Democrats have since claimed that the case is about nothing but bank fraud.\nBank fraud does not explain why the Awans were kicked off the House network concurrent with the urgent memo, which did not cite bank fraud.\nA Democratic IT aide who alleged that Imran solicited a bribe from him told TheDCNF he believes members of Congress are playing dumb and covering the matter up.\nWendy Anderson, a former chief of staff to New York Rep. Yvette Clarke, told House investigators that she suspected that her predecessor, Shelley Davis, was working with Abid on a theft scheme, but Clarke refused to fire Abid until outside investigators got involved, TheDCNF reported.\nEighteen months after the evidence was recounted in the urgent memo, prosecution appears to have stalled for reasons not publicly explained.\nImran is in court July 3 for a possible plea deal in the bank fraud case.\nGohmert said the FBI has refused to accept evidence demonstrating alleged House misconduct, and some witnesses with first-hand knowledge say the bureau has not interviewed them.\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|8476|8487\nName_Calling,Labeling|5083|5102\nLoaded_Language|50|58\nName_Calling,Labeling|62|91\nLoaded_Language|217|236\nFlag-Waving|242|281\nLoaded_Language|1260|1268\nDoubt|5221|5426\nLoaded_Language|6542|6575\nDoubt|7254|7366\nLoaded_Language|9281|9297\nDoubt|93|281\nDoubt|5704|5794."}
{"prompt":"Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?\n\nLast Friday, President Trump made the following announcement:\nI have decided not to block release of the CIA’s remaining JFK-assassination related records except for those records that directly implicate the CIA in the assassination, which will continue to remain secret.”\nOkay, he didn’t really put it like that.\nBut that’s the potential and likely import of his announcement, which actually read as follows:\nSubject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.” (Italics added.)\nThe operative words, of course, are: “Subject to the receipt of further information….”\nWhat is going on here?\nNegotiations.\nThe art of the deal.\nThe CIA desperately does not want to show the American people its long-secret JFK-related records.\nIt has asked Trump to continue keeping at least some of them secret notwithstanding the passage of more than 50 years since the Kennedy assassination.\nUnder long-established custom and tradition in Washington, D.C., when someone asks someone else for a favor, the person who is in a position to grant the favor demands something in return.\nThat’s where the negotiations between Trump and the CIA come into play.\nTrump wants something in return.\nWe don’t know what — maybe laying off on the Russia investigation — but his announcement last Friday is obviously part of the concluding steps of such negotiations.\nTime to buy old US gold coins\nWhat Trump has done with his announcement is send a clear message to the CIA: “Give me what I want and I’ll give you want you want.\nOtherwise, I will let all your cherished long-secret records relating to the JFK assassination be shown to the American people.”\nMake no mistake about it: A deal is about to be made.\nThe CIA will cave.\nIt will end up giving Trump whatever it is he wants.\nTrump is in the driver’s seat because the CIA cannot afford to permit the American people to see the records it wants to continue to be kept secret.\nAnd once the CIA gives Trump what he wants, he will cave and give the CIA the continued secrecy it so desperately needs.\nAll this will happen by this Thursday, the date set by law for release of all the JFK records that Trump has not blocked.\nThink about it: The CIA has asked the president to continue secrecy of records that are more than 50 years old or, apparently, some relating to secret correspondence between the CIA and the Assassination Records Review Board back in the 1990s.\nThe CIA’s ground?\n“National security” of course, the two most important and meaningless words in the American political lexicon.\nNational security?\nReally?\nWhatever definition that one might put on that nebulous term, no reasonable person can honestly believe that the release of 50-year-old records are going to result in the United States falling into the ocean or even that the communists are going to take over the federal government.\nThe CIA says that releasing its decades-old JFK records will reveal secret “methods” of intelligence gathering.\nReally?\nWhat, like the CIA was using typewriters instead of computers and pay telephones instead of cell phones?\nWhat is amazing (or not) is the extreme nonchalance of the mainstream media to the CIA’s request for continued secrecy.\nThat should be big news.\nIt’s essentially an admission of guilt, given that it is absolutely ludicrous to think that “national security” would be threatened by the release of the CIA’s long-secret JFK-assassination-related records.\nYou see, the mainstream media starts with the assumption that the CIA had nothing to do with the assassination.\nIn their minds, the assassination was committed by a lone nut former U.S. Marine communist, one who had no motive to kill the president.\nSuch being the case, the mainstream media, deferring to the CIA, automatically concludes that its wish to continue keeping secret has to be based on “national security” grounds rather than an attempt by the CIA to continue its cover-up of its assassination of the president.\nLet’s proceed from the opposite assumption: That the CIA, in partnership with the military and the Mafia, orchestrated the assassination by framing a former U.S. Marine who was then working for U.S. intelligence, either Navy intelligence, the CIA, or the FBI, or a combination of all three.\nDon’t forget, after all, that that’s what Oswald said.\nHe said he was being framed.\nYet, from the very beginning, the mainstream media has never given any serious consideration to the possibility that Oswald was framed for the crime.\nInstead, they have steadfastly stuck with the official story, one that has all the characteristics of a pat frame-up: That Oswald acted alone or possibly acted in concert with others, both of which lead to nothing but dead ends, contradictions, and anomalies.\nNow, let’s assume instead that Oswald was telling the truth when he said he was being framed.\nIn that case, it would be imperative that the CIA and the military keep as tight a lid on their records as possible to ensure that investigators or investigative reporters would have a difficult time piercing through to the circumstantial evidence that establishes the frame-up.\nAs part of the frame-up, the CIA would have to fortify the persona of Oswald, its intelligence agent, as a purported communist.\nThat would enable the CIA to blame the assassination on a communist, which, not coincidentally, was the advice that the Pentagon and the CIA were doling out to Latin American military dictatorships at the School of the Americas.\nIn cases of covert state-sponsored assassinations, Latin American regimes were taught, a good strategy was to blame the assassination on a communist because then they could smear anyone who challenged the official story as a communist sympathizer.\nIt would also explain why the CIA was closely monitoring Oswald’s movements prior to the assassination, something else that the CIA kept secret for decades.\nThey had to make certain that Oswald was not on to them and had not discovered that he was being set up for a frame-up.\nThe first organization that came out with a press release advertising Oswald’s bona fides was the DRE, an anti-communist group in New Orleans with which Oswald had had contact.\nWhat no one knew at the time, and what the CIA intentionally kept secret for decades, was that the DRE was a CIA front organization.\nIt was being generously funded by the CIA and controlled by a secret CIA agent named George Joannides, which the CIA would intentionally keep secret from the Warren Commission in the 1960s, the House Select Committee in the 1970s, and the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.\nBut there was another big operation to establish Oswald’s communist bona fides before the assassination.\nIt had to do with Oswald’s trip to Mexico City, where he visited the Cuban and Soviet embassies.\nSomething dreadful obviously went wrong with that part of the operation because the official investigation into it was quickly shut down during the early post-assassination period.\nToday, Oswald’s Mexico City trip, which is part of those CIA records ready to be released, is still shrouded in mystery.\nThe CIA’s continued secrecy in the JFK assassination is no big surprise.\nAs I wrote in my October 11 article, “Will Trump Make a Deal with the CIA on JFK Records?,” the CIA is between a rock and a hard place.\nOn the one hand, it knows that those records will further implicate the CIA in the Kennedy assassination.\nOn the other hand, it knows that by seeking continued secrecy, it’s essentially an implicit acknowledgment of guilt.\nNot surprisingly, it is choosing the latter course, especially because it knows that its assets and allies in the mainstream press will continue to come to its defense with respect to its ridiculous claim of “national security.”\nDo the CIA’s long-secret records contain a video-taped confession?\nOf course not.\nAnd they don’t contain any reference to assassinating Kennedy.\nThe CIA’s practice from the very beginning has been to not put any reference to a state-sponsored assassination into writing.\nBut there has to be a reason why the CIA chose to keep this particular batch of records secret for more than 50 years.\nThose long-secret records undoubtedly include small bits of important circumstantial evidence that fill out even further the mosaic of a regime-change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963, the same types of regime-change operation that took place in Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Cuba in 1960-1963, Congo in 1961, and Chile in 1973, all of which the CIA steadfastly kept secret from the American people.\nIn 1953, the CIA was in the process of developing a top-secret manual on assassinations, one that showed that the CIA was specializing not only in the art of assassination but also in the art of covering up its role in state-sponsored assassinations.\nEvery American owes it to himself to read that manual.\nToo bad the mainstream press has never given that manual the consideration it deserves.\nIf it did, it might not be so deferential to the deal that Trump and the CIA are about to make to continue the JFK assassination cover-up by continuing to keep some of the CIA’s decades-old JFK’s related assassination records secret from the American people.\nReprinted with permission from The Future of Freedom Foundation.\nThe

{"prompt":"Muslim Dem IT Aides' Family Member Paid $45,000 After Hiring Attorney Specializing In Money Laundering Cases\n\nAbid Awan, a member of a family of highly paid Democratic IT aides, was awarded a $45,000 payout in court after he enlisted a high profile attorney specializing in money laundering cases to defeat his stepmother in a bitter dispute over his father’s life insurance policy.\nAwan removed the stepmother, Samina Gilani, as the longstanding beneficiary of the policy and replaced her with himself around the period of his father’s death, according to legal and insurance papers.\nThe stepmother, Samina Gilani, also claimed in 2017 that Abid’s brother Imran Awan held her in “captivity” and wiretapped and extorted her, weeks after the House Office of Inspector General separately alleged that they made “unauthorized access” to congressmen’s data.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do

of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nAbid’s attorney James Bacon mocked the elderly, burka-clad widow, who does not drive and speaks only Uurdu.\n“She’s a wacko lunatic, what are you going to do?” he said just outside the courtroom doors as the judge took a break to deliberate.\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation was present at the court hearing.\nAssociates and relatives have long accused the family of green.\n“For the sake of money they would have done anything,” Gilani’s cousin, Syed Ahmed, told the Daily Mail.\n“There are possibilities that [Imran] or them might have been selling [House] information,” he added.\n(Syed Ahmed knew Abid well enough to loan him money, according to bankruptcy documents filed by Abid.)\nThe FBI arrested Imran, the eldest of the three Awan brothers, at Dulles Airport trying to fly to Pakistan in July, and prosecutors charged him with fraudulently gathering money the prior winter to wire overseas, possibly in an attempt to flee the investigation into the family’s activities involving House computers.\n“Based on the suspicious timing of that transaction, Awan and [wife Hina] Alvi likely knew they were under investigation at that time” and “there are strong indications of flight in this case,” prosecutors wrote.\nAbid was making his own efforts to round up money at the same time via the life insurance policy.\nOn Nov. 16, 2016, the brothers made a video of his bedridden father signing over ownership — but not changing the beneficiary — of his life insurance policy to Abid.\nAbid then used those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary.\nWhen his father died on Jan. 16, 2017, the youngest Awan brother, Jamal, attested on the death certificate provided to the insurance company that his father was divorced, a statement Gilani’s lawyer said would have kept her from the money.\nA Virginia court later ruled that Jamal’s statement about his marital status on the certificate was wrong.\n“Why is that even relevant?” Bacon said of Jamal’s misstatement at the March 7 court date.\nOn Dec. 12, 2016, Imran and Alvi – who was also on the House payroll – began taking a series of withdrawals from banks, some of which federal prosecutors say occurred under fraudulent pretenses.\nIn January 2017, Imran wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan.\nImran wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan Jan. 18, according to the indictment.\nOn Jan. 17, Abid filed notarized papers using those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary.\nThe life insurance change’s timing seems to coincide with other moves by Abid to liquidate property and transfer it.\nTen weeks prior, on Nov. 1, 2016, Alvi sold a house to Jamal for $620,000, netting another significant profit from the mortgage company.\nIn addition to his primary residence, Abid owned the house where his mother and stepfather lived, and moved in after his death, with Gilani becoming homeless.\nAbid owned two homes despite a $1 million 2012 bankruptcy that might ordinarily have forced him to sell the second home to pay creditors.\nAt that time, he filed forms “under penalty of perjury” that two houses were needed as “my spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purposes of evading the requirements.”\nHowever, his wife, Ukrainian-born Nataliia Sova – who also was on the House payroll – signed as a witness on the 2016 life insurance form as “spouse of Abid,” and they have been photographed living together.\nGilani told TheDCNF the brothers were trying to use the life insurance policy as leverage to persuade her to sign a power of attorney giving them access to “assets of my late husband in Pakistan,” which were much more valuable than the $50,000 policy.\nAmerico, the life insurance company, said there was “great doubt” about who the rightful policy holder was, given the allegations of fraud, and sent the decision to the courts to sort out on April 14, two months after the House sargent-at-arms banned the Awans for “suspicious activity.”\nGilani alleged the brothers took her financial documents, a laptop, and her husband’s possessions.\nThe only lawyer she could afford, she claimed, was Michael Hadeed, a business attorney who was convicted in 2010 of conspiracy and immigration fraud for helping aliens obtain green cards by setting them up with fake employment relationships.\nHe lost his bar license for two years, according to Virginia State Bar documents.\nHadeed did not introduce any evidence to the judge about a pattern of possible fraud by Abid, the timing of the move as it relates to the federal criminal case, or the mental capacity of the dying man to understand paperwork.\nHadeed withdrew earlier allegations of fraud and asked the judge to try the case based solely on interpretation of contract language.\nAfter court, Hadeed told reporters Bacon had threatened to sue him for defamation.\n“I don’t want to subject myself to that,” he said outside court.\n“I don’t want to get myself in a lawsuit over this.”\nIn court, Bacon badgered Hadeed.\n“Are you going to share any more info with them?\nI hope not.\nI hope you learned that lesson,” he said.\n“You have no control over [Gilani], do you?\nYou’re like, talking to a wall,” he said of Gilani.\nHadeed said three different signatures from Abid on financial documents did not match, and put a defiant Abid on the witness stand.\nHadeed: Why do your signatures look different?\nAbid: My signatures are not very consistent, I’m just a human being…\nHadeed: You were aware you were changing beneficiary from your father’s spouse to yourself?\nAbid: That was my father’s request…\nHadeed: You’re not answering the question.\nAbid: I’m not very smart, so it takes a while sometimes…\nJudge: I don’t understand why the witness is having such trouble with the question.\nYour job is to answer the question.\nIn court documents, Gilani alleged, “while he was admitted in hospital my telephone conversations were taped and some other recording devices were also installed\/planted in my house … Imran Awan showed up and threatened me for me calling the police.\n[Imran] threatened that he is very powerful and if I ever call the police again [he] will do harm to me.” She said that Imran eventually agreed to remove the listening devices and did so in front of her.\nBased on Hadeed’s narrow legal argument about the life insurance contract’s language, the judge ruled that, “The son as the owner of the policy has the absolute right to change the beneficiary.”\nAfter Gilani retained a lawyer, Bacon had offered a settlement where they’d split the money, but Gilani declined it.\nThe court awarded Abid the $50,000 life insurance payout, minus $5,000 that the insurance company took for its expenses in litigating the fraud allegations.\n“You should have taken the settlement.\nNow she’s not getting a penny,” Bacon said in court.\n“You’re not getting anything.”\nGilani said after court that her conscience didn’t allow her to settle.\n“I didn’t do the deal because they had been adopting bad behaviors.\nI cannot agree to that.\nIt wasn’t about the money,” she said.\nArticle posted with permission from The Daily Caller News

Danny Davis thinks Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a notorious racist and anti-Semite, does “outstanding work” but doesn’t agree with Farrakhan’s positions that white people are “devils” and Jewish people are satanic.\nProgress!\n\"I don’t spend a lot of time, I buy Final Call when I see them.\nI’ve been to Saviour’s Day, I’ve read, I’ve been a fan of Elijah Muhammad, so those are my positions, but I do disagree with the notion that white people are devils.”\nI wonder how far a white congressman would get saying, \"I attended the Klavern, but I don't agree with the KKK's views about black people.\"\nBut that's Rep. Davis' current views.\nHe likes a racist hate group.\nBut doesn't believe white people are devils or Jews are satanic.\nWhoever the JTA has on the \"explain away Farrakhan's Dem fandom\" beat is going to be busy again.\nBut this is typical of the Dems and their useful idiots.\nAnd J Street is on record as endorsing a politician who praised a racist hate group leader and discussed the \"Jewish question.\"\n>","completion":" Loaded_Language|2410|2465\nName_Calling,Labeling|2428|2434\nName_Calling,Labeling|2458|2465\nName_Calling,Labeling|2682|2705\nName_Calling,Labeling|2953|2959\nName_Calling,Labeling|2972|2979\nName_Calling,Labeling|3120|3133\nSlogans|374|389\nExaggeration,Minimisation|744|800\nExaggeration,Minimisation|642|665\nExaggeration,Minimisation|422|438\nExaggeration,Minimisation|216|240\nExaggeration,Minimisation|2342|2359\nDoubt|2710|2754\nAppeal_to_Authority|440|860\nThought-terminating_Cliches|1854|1958\nName_Calling,Labeling|2300|2334\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|2477|2707\nWhataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring|2708|2847\nName_Calling,Labeling|3174|3262."}

story.\nRefresh the page for updates.\n(Tallahassee) Project Veritas Action Fund has released undercover video from Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum’s campaign, revealing his election strategy includes making empty promises to voters.\nThis is the seventh undercover video report Project Veritas has released in a series revealing secrets and lies from political campaigns in 2018.\nSaid James O’Keefe, founder and president of Project Veritas Action:\n“What we found in the Gillum campaign was just what we found in Missouri, Tennessee and Arizona, a candidate lying to the voters he needs to win the election.”\nGillum campaign makes promises it knows it can’t keep\nFeatured in this report is a campaign staffer who works on Andrew Gillum’s gubernatorial campaign.\nOmar Smith, who says he went to college with Gillum, reveals Gillum cannot fulfill his campaign promises even if he wanted to.\nWhen asked how Gillum would fund all the programs he says he wants to fund, Smith says Gillum “can’t,” and when asked if voters are aware that Gillum cannot deliver on his proposed programs, Smith says:\nSMITH: “That’s not for them to know… That’s not for them to know.\nRemember our saying, modern day fairy tales start with ‘once I am elected.\n'”\nSmith explains that most of Gillum’s campaign promises could never be implemented, and that the Gillum campaign knows this:\nSMITH: “So, let’s go back to Mr. Gillum’s platform, right?\nRaise the corporate tax in Florida from 7 to 11 percent.\nThat will never happen.\nRaise teacher’s pay to $50,000, that will never happen.\nGive me another position.\nMedicare for all, that will never happen.\nThe reason being, the legislature that write the bills is all Republican controlled.\nDemocratic governor, Republican legislature.\nSo, unless the legislature writes a bill, and it got voted on the floor, it cannot pass.”\nSmith says that “the rules in Florida are f***ed up” and that Florida is a “cracker state,” explaining that the Florida legislature has to become racially black for Gillum’s agenda to advance.\n“Whip up” the poor into a “frenzy in order for them to vote.”\nSmith says that in order to get voters on board with Gillum’s fairy tale platform, the campaign must “whip” lower income individuals “into a frenzy.”\nSMITH: “You whip ’em up.\nThe poor, the middle income.\nYou have to whip them up into a frenzy in order for them to vote.\nOnce Gillum is in, in another 2 years, other Republican Senators and Legislators will be on the ballot.\nSo, you have to whip up the Andrew Gillum voters again in those counties to vote out the Republican to get a Democratic Legislature in order for his (Gillum) will to be executed.”\nSmith adds that because not all Democratic voters are the same, that the Gillum campaign needs to appeal to “white guilt” to turn out the vote:\nSMITH: “You have to appeal to white guilt… [be]cause that’s what it is.”\nSmith also explains that the Gillum campaign can’t let voters know what Gillum’s true agenda is before election day:\nSMITH: “… We don’t, do we have to let [the voters] know what the agenda is ahead of time?\nWe can’t… We cannot… You alienate everybody.\nThen you get painted like, oh, Gillum is being painted, no.\nYou are a socialist, you are way out of left field…”\nGillum is a “crazy, crazy,” Democrat\nSmith also explains Gillum’s political worldview, saying that “Gillum is a progressive… He is a part of the crazy crazy crazies.”\nCliff Eserman, who works for the Broward County Democratic Party adds that during the Democratic primary, Gillum had to campaign on values he does not really believe:\nESERMAN: “In order to win he had to be… He’s really left of center.\nSo he was being left, not left of center… For the primary.\nNow [in the general] he’s going back to left of center.”\nDale Holeness, who is the Broward County Commissioner and also works on Gillum’s campaign, explains Gillum’s gun control views:\nHOLENESS: “There ought to be at least a three-day waiting period for everybody and a full background check for everybody… And we need to- And these automatic guns with sixteen rounds a minute, they ought to not be on the streets either, so that’s his plan.”\nAdrian Young, who works for the Florida Democratic Party also elaborates on Gillum’s gun control views in the report:\nYOUNG: “… I do think he’s not saying specifically like I’m going to ban bump stocks or I’m against ATs, only because he’s running a race right now.\nI do think he would support anybody doing that stuff, Bill Nelson… But I don’t think he can say it just [be]cause he’s trying to get the moderates and the gun-toting people in North Florida…”\nMore Elections…\nThis is the seventh release in a series Project Veritas

{"prompt":"Security Guard Jesus Campos Shot During The Vegas Massacre Raises New Questions About Official Narrative\n\nThe infamous security guard at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, who was allegedly shot stopping the massacre in Las Vegas over a week ago is not listed or registered as such.\nJesus Campos, who the narrative is constantly changing around, is still a source of mystery.\nSo who is Jesus Campos?\nThat burning question has bothered many since the release of his name, but there’s been no photograph of this alleged hero, even though we’ve already seen crime scene images of the guns Stephen Paddock allegedly dragged up to his 32nd-floor hotel room.\nThe ever-changing narrative now though, seems to swirl around this unknown mystery security guard.\nAt first, Campos, a guard at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, was hailed a hero for helping guide police to gunman Stephen Paddock’s room on the 32nd floor.\nPolice said Campos was shot in the leg at the end of Paddock’s assault on concertgoers—potentially distracting the gunman and causing him to panic and kill himself.\nBut now, questions have been raised after Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo revised the timeline and said Campos had actually been shot about 9:59 p.m. a (full six minutes before the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m.) which means the guard could have instead led Paddock to start opening fire on the crowd for fear of being caught.\nPolice have said it was difficult to identify the source of the bullets during the attack, and the confusion added more minutes to their lengthy response.\nBut the revised timeline shows officers would have known where Paddock was before the mass shooting even started.\nDid Campos call 911?\nWhat happened during those six minutes?\nMuch of Campos’s story and background remains a mystery.\n–Newsweek\nCampos’s co-worker Liliana Rodriguez started a GoFundMe account for him on October 3, explaining that he’d been shot while on “random patrol” and it could have been anyone of us.\n“Funds will be used to provide relief and financial support for him while he gets back on his feet,” Rodriguez’s online petition says.\n“This is a young man that I work with day in and day out.\nAny financial support would be appreciated for the time he would need to recover.”\nStrangely, a picture of Campos wasn’t displayed as part of the fund because Rodriguez indicated that “due to privacy from the media we do not feel comfortable publishing a photo.”\nThere are obviously certain things that the FBI and other investigators seem intent on covering up.\nTheir own narrative is quickly shattering.\nLas Vegas Metro Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill explained more about Campos’s actions the night of the shooting, helping fill in some of what happened ahead of the attack, but unfortunately, it only added more questions and gave little in the way of answers.\nMcMahill told KNPR, a local NPR affiliate, that Campos went up to the 32nd floor to investigate a door alarm.\nWhile on the 32nd floor, he found that a stairwell door was jammed and radioed down to maintenance.\nCampos heard a drilling sound and thought it was odd.\nA maintenance worker came up to the 32nd floor.\nAs the pair started talking, Paddock began firing through the door of his room, first with a single-fire gun and then with a rapid-fire rifle.\nPolice have said that when Campos radioed what happened, it helped them track where Paddock was holed up – so why change the narrative to make it even more unbelievable?\nAnd still, none of this explains why Campos is not registered as a security guard either, and why the timeline is being changed publically.\nWhat exactly do they want us to believe?\nArticle posted with permission from SHTFPlan\n>","completion":" Doubt|3600|3640\nDoubt|2430|2528\nDoubt|3397|3459."}
