“But what was most surprising, and heartbreaking was when the team located a total of five adults and 11 children that looked like third world country refugees not only with no food or fresh water, but with no shoes, personal hygiene and basically dirty rags for clothing.”
The body of a yound boy was also located, however, it is not clear if the boy is the missing child from Georgia. Both males were arrested; Morton was charged with harboring a fugitive and Wahhaj was booked on his no bond Georgia warrant for child abduction. The three females believed to be the mothers of the eleven children, Jany Leveille age 35, Hujrah Wahhaj age 38, and Subhannah Wahhaj age 35 were arrested without incident in Taos and were later booked in the Taos Adult Detention Center. “We all gave the kids our water and what snacks we had – it was the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen.”
None of the adults would give statement to the current whereabouts of AG Wahhaj, but it is reasonably believed he was there a few weeks ago. The investigation is fluid and ongoing. Advertisements
