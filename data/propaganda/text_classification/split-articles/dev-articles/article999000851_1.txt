White House Restores CNN Acosta’s Pass But Imposes Strict Conduct Rules

Thanks to Jim Acosta, all White House correspondents have to adhere to the new rules. CNN’s White House correspondent Jim Acosta will get his “hard pass” restored, but thanks to his antics and confrontations with President Trump and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, all journalists seeking access to the presidential press room will now have to abide by written rules of conduct due to his misbehavior. Sanders and deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine sent a letter to Acosta on Monday, notifying him that his hard pass was restored, but that it could be suspended or revoked again if he fails to abide by the new rules that apply to all White House correspondents going forward. Under the rules laid out in the letter, each journalist gets “a single question” before having to yield the floor, with follow-ups solely at the discretion of White House officials. Failure to obey the rules may result in suspension or revocation of the “hard pass,” the document allowing major networks regular access to the White House, RT reports.
