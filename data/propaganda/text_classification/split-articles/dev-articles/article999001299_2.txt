However, the cable news channel is showing more and more that it is not fair and balanced and is far from what conservatives think it is as it blasted the White House about not giving little Jimmy his press pass back. In a statement by Fox News President Jay Wallace, he wrote:
“Fox News supports CNN in its legal effort to regain its White House reporter’s press credential. We intend to file an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court. Secret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized. While we don’t condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the president and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people." So, file it! On the basis of what, Mr. Wallace? The free press still exists, and you know what? Jim Acosta and CNN continue to lie, just like they have for decades, and here's the proof. Look how they doctored the video to not show what clearly took place and then lied about it, and I suppose Fox falls right in line with that behavior. So, Fox joins with the least trusted name in news, the Clown News Network, to go after the White House on something that is the White House's prerogative and claim it's about free press. It's not. Fox reported:
The White House Correspondents’ Association – of which Fox News is a member – issued a statement in support of CNN’s decision to take legal action.
