“We continue to urge the administration to reverse course and fully reinstate CNN’s correspondent,” WHCA President Olivier Knox said. “The President of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.” However, several prominent media members – such as Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate journalist Bob Woodward – have criticized CNN over the lawsuit. As they should. It's frivolous, but because they are immature children over at CNN, it's not surprising, and frankly, it's no surprise coming from Fox either. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called the CNN lawsuit "grandstanding." I wonder what she will call the amicus brief from Fox. "This is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit,” Sanders said. “CNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment. After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions — each of which the President answered — he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions. This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.”
Of course, CNN was thrilled as Fox more than likely helped them grow a little in ratings by issuing support. The propaganda outlet tweeted out Fox's statement. Fox News will file an amicus brief in support of @Acosta and CNN. Thank you @FoxNews!
