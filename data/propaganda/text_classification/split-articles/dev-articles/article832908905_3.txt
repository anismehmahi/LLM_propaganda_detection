Let people see it,” he said. No collusion
Mueller’s investigation, which began nearly two years ago, has resulted in 200 charges against 34 people and three Russian companies. Six former Trump advisers have been indicted for process crimes, including perjury. However, there have been no indictments related to alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Trump has insisted from the beginning that the probe is a “witch hunt.”
Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who has investigated Russian interference as a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has been a critic of the Mueller probe. ‏
“The Mueller report delivery suggests no more indictments are coming from the Special Counsel. If that’s true, it would mean we just completed 2 years of investigating ‘Russian collusion’ without ONE collusion related indictment. Not even one,” he wrote on Twitter. “Why? Because there was no collusion.”
