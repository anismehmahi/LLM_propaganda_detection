Accused Woman Abuser Keith Ellison Asks House Ethics to Investigate

Well, unlike Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), who is running for attorney general in Minnesota without an active attorney's license, has not stood before a committee to deny or address accusations against him by several women who have accused him of verbal and physical abuse. At least one woman even filed a police report about his abuse. No, Ellison has called on the House of Representatives, not the FBI, as Senate Democrats have urged in the case of Judge Kavanaugh, to investigate the claims. "I am taking this step now because I am innocent and eager to see this entire matter resolved,” Ellison said in a statement. “These allegations have lingered in the public sphere, and remain unsubstantiated," he added. "I welcome an investigation by the House to allow us to move on." take our poll - story continues below
