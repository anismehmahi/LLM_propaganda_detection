The other would be given to a smaller group of lawmakers who head major congressional committees, such as the House and Senate intelligence committees. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chairman of House Intelligence, called for transparency. “Mueller’s investigation began as a counterintelligence inquiry into whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign were compromised by a foreign power. By law, that evidence he uncovered must be shared with our Committee,” he said in a tweet. “And his report must also be made public. Now.”
Trump has previously said he supports the idea of making the report public. “I don’t mind,” he has said. “I mean, frankly, I told the House, ‘If you want, let them see it.’”
Trump has also vigorously denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly branded the probe as a “total witch hunt.”
Mueller will remain as special counsel for a period of time as he and a small contingent of staff close the office, a Justice Department spokesperson reportedly said. The handover of the report marks the end of an investigation that has for nearly two years transfixed the nation, yielded dozens of indictments and convictions, and brought down a handful of Trump’s closest advisers. The Special Counsel’s Office was tasked broadly with investigating any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign, as well as any matters that arose directly from the probe. However, the scope of the investigation seems to have bled outside those lines.
