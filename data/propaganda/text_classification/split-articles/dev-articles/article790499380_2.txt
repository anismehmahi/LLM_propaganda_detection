We do have a police report, unlike the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh. Of course, his supporters have hired an attorney to perform an investigation. The Star Tribune reports:
The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party has hired attorney Susan Ellingstad to conduct a separate investigation. Ellingstad is a partner at the firm where attorney Charles Nauen, who represents the DFL, works. DFL Chairman Ken Martin said on Tuesday that the investigation was finished or close to finished and would be released soon. Ellison is also deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee. After the domestic abuse allegation emerged in August, the DNC said it is looking into what happened. “All allegations of domestic abuse are disturbing and should be taken seriously. We are working with the Minnesota state party to review these allegations,” a DNC spokeswoman said in a statement Wednesday morning, declining to comment further. The Democratic Party’s choice of Ellingstad to conduct the investigation was met with derision from many who said she is not independent, including Donald Trump Jr., who mocked the investigation in a Tweet Wednesday. The firm Ellingstad works for, Lockridge Grindal Nauen, has a political committee that has donated to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Ellison, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The contributions to Democrats outweigh the Republicans by a margin of about four to one.
