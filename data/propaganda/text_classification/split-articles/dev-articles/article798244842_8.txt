The Takeaway
Recognize what’s happening, the massive censorship of information, coupled with the ridicule or finger pointing, or even arrest of people who choose to voice an opinion in opposition to the rhetoric that’s constantly spewed by mainstream media, which in turn is usually believed by the masses. At the same time, independent media represents a shift in consciousness. A shift in our perceptions, thoughts, feelings and general self-awareness about our own planet is changing, and thus, change has been sprouted in multiple different areas, including political corruption and the stranglehold it has over our world. We are more aware, but there is still some ways to go…
A good chunk of work has been done. A massive transformation of consciousness has taken place and it seems that a global mass is growing closer to a critical mass. The censorship of independent media is irrelevant in a sense, because the shift will continue to happen, change will continue to happen, and information that the deep state does not want the public to become aware of will keep making its way into transparency. Independent media will continue to have the opportunity to share information because of a lack of credible information and plain truth within the mainstream. People are hungry for it, and will seek it out themselves. Reprinted with permission from Collective Evolution.
