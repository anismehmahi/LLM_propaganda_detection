Steven Colbert, you're lying. Jimmy Kimmel, you're lying. CNN, you're lying. CNN's Jim Acosta told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he *never* touched the female White House aide that tried to take the mic away from him. CNN showed the clip but edited out the part where he clearly touched her. Cooper offered no pushback on Acosta's blatant lie. pic.twitter.com/65rP9xWWyI — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) November 8, 2018
Jim Acosta, you're lying. New York Times, you're lying. Every media outlet from the Associated Press to NBC, you're lying when you say the video was doctored and that Acosta didn't touch the woman. At least C-SPAN is neutral in the matter and simply let the video reprove every single one of them. But it's more than that, self-proclaimed "fact checkers" like Snopes simply posted an Associated Press article, which clearly biased towards indicating the video was "doctored" by saying it was sped up, but that's not doctoring. Doctoring is when you manipulate the content to misconstrue the reality of what took place. If you want to see doctoring, go to 0:58 of the video above, and don't be drinking anything when you do because it's hilarious. But it isn't just Snopes or Politifact and outlets like that.
