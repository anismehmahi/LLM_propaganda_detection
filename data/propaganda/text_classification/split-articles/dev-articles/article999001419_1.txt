Trump Vows to Kick CNN’s Acosta Out Again

President Trump took CNN’s improbable court victory temporarily restoring CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta’s “hard pass” media credential for the executive mansion in stride, vowing to kick Acosta out again in the future if he breaches White House protocol again. The yanking of the physical credential, by the way, isn’t exactly a grave hardship. It just means Acosta would need to make an appointment through the White House press office every time he wanted to visit the White House grounds, just as the rest of the non-hard pass-holding journalists who don’t work for big media outlets like CNN have to do. Lacking a hard pass does not prevent anyone from reporting on the White House. Speaking to Chris Wallace of Fox News Channel in an interview that aired Sunday, Trump had some new ideas on how to deal with Acosta, who picks fights with him during pressers. "I think one of the things we’ll do is maybe turn the camera off that faces them, because then they don’t have any air time, although I’ll probably be sued for that and maybe, you know, win or lose it, who knows," Trump said. "I mean, with this stuff you never know what’s going to happen." The president described Acosta as "unbelievably rude to [White House Press Secretary] Sarah Huckabee, who’s a wonderful woman," and said his administration is drawing up "rules and regulations" for White House reporters.
