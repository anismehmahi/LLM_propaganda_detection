Blue Privilege: Amber Guyger Free on Bail as Activists Who Peacefully Protested Her Rot in Jail

The case of Amber Guyger, the police officer who admitted to shooting 26-year-old Botham Jean in his apartment for no reason, is a glaring example of “blue privilege” at work in our society. Guyger claims that she accidentally entered the wrong apartment and shot a man who she thought was a burglar, however, eyewitness testimony has contradicted her initial statement. Despite admitting to killing an innocent man and having her initial statement contradicted by witness testimony, Guyger has been treated as more of a victim than a killer. In fact, Guyger’s apartment was never even searched for evidence, and she was allowed to “vacate” the premises without any type of search. By not searching her apartment immediately, police ruined the investigation, making it harder to prosecute her. It would be reasonable to assume that these steps were taken intentionally because they want to see her get away with it. take our poll - story continues below
