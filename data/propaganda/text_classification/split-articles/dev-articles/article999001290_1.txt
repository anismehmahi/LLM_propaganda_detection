Judge Orders White House To Restore Jim Acosta' Press Pass - Trump Responds

A Trump appointed federal judge has order the White House to restore CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass after the White House revoked it for his badgering of the White House press secretary, his handling of a White House aide and his continual questioning when he was allowed to ask a question and follow up. The ruling has no basis in the Constitution, mind you. USA Today reported on the ruling:
WASHINGTON – A federal judge on Friday ordered the White House to restore CNN reporter Jim Acosta’s press badge, which had been revoked earlier this month after a contentious exchange at a news conference with President Donald Trump. U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, said the White House had violated Acosta’s Fifth Amendment right to due process by suspending his press badge without explanation or a chance for CNN to appeal the decision. Kelly said White House officials couldn’t say who made the decision or how. The judge ordered the government to restore the credential while the rest of the case – which drew a slew of support from other media outlets, including USA TODAY – is argued. “This court cannot restore Mr. Acosta’s access to press briefings that have already been held,” Kelly said. But Kelly said he hasn’t considered at all yet whether the White House violated Acosta’s First Amendment rights. More arguments are expected Tuesday.
