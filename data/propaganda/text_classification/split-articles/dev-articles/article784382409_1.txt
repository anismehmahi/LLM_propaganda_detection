Pit Bull Journalist Hounds Keith Ellison Over Abuse Of Women - Watch Him Flee! Investigative journalist Laura Loomer tracked down Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), aka Hakim Muhammad, at an event he was at on Saturday and questioned him about the police reports filed against him by women who claimed he abused them.
