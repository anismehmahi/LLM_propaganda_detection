Father allegedly took boy in November
Abdul-Ghani's mother, Hakima Ramzi, could not be reached after authorities announced the discovery of the remains. But hours earlier, Ramzi told CNN she had no idea he'd disappear with their son for nine months, only to be found across the country with 11 other children
"My husband said he was taking Abdul-Ghani to the park, and didn't come back. That was in November 2017. When I would ask him where he was, he said he was on his way, he was coming soon, he was just keeping him for the night. But I haven't seen him since then," Ramzi said Tuesday. She said her son cannot walk and suffers seizures, and requires constant medical attention. An arrest warrant states that Wahhaj "wanted to perform an exorcism" on the child because he believed he was possessed by the devil. But Ramzi said her husband was planning to perform a ruqya -- an Islamic practice involving prayer that is believed to help rid a body of illness. "It's not an exorcism. That was a translation issue in the court," Ramzi said. He "just wanted to pray for Abdul-Ghani to get better." Police stopped the father in Alabama
In December, days after Ramzi reported her son missing, the child's father was involved in an accident in Alabama, according to a police report. The SUV had seven children -- but none of them was listed with Abdul-Ghani's date of birth. Siraj Wahhaj is accused of fleeing Georgia with his young son. But at the time, the group told Alabama police they were headed to New Mexico for camping, and continued on their way.
