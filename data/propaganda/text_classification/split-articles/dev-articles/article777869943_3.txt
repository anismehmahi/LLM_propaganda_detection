Compound wasn't searched thoroughly, couple say
When officers executed a search warrant on the compound, they found a horrifying scene. Stacks of tires, piles of trash and plastic sheets surrounded the compound. Obscured by the junk was a trailer where the 11 children and five adults were living. The children wore dirty rags for clothing with no shoes, and were surrounded by weapons and rounds of ammunition, authorities said. "It was the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen," Hogrefe said. The father of the missing boy, Siraj Wahhaj, was arrested at the compound Friday along with his sisters Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj and two other adults -- Lucas Morten and Jany Leveille. All have been charged with abuse of the 11 children. Morten was charged with harboring a fugitive. However, the Badgers said that police did not do a thorough job searching the property. The couple said they went back over the weekend after they found out Abdul-Ghani wasn't among the 11 children discovered during the raid. Tanya and Jason Badger said they told authorities they had seen a boy they thought was Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj. They said they were surprised to see the scene was not taped off and was still largely untouched. They found two guns, ammo, tactical vests and video cameras that police initially missed, Jason Badger said. "When we first went up there, nothing was overturned," he said. "You could tell nobody had looked underneath that, nobody had looked underneath this."
