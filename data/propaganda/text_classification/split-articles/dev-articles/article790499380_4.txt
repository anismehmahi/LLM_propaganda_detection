It's hard to know what really happened in a relationship. And the media has kept it quiet. "Keith Ellison flatly denies allegation that he abused an ex girlfriend. The story had been circulating in MN, and not held up under media scrutiny, so no stories ran. It blew up last night after the exâ€™s son posted the allegation on Facebook." Dave Weigel. It's not quite the first time for Keith X. This is not the first time Ellison has faced misconduct allegations. In 2006, a woman named Amy Alexandar claimed that Ellison ostracized her and smeared her name after having an extramarital affair with her in the 1990s and then again in the 2000s. Ellison in 2005 filed a restraining order against her after what he described as phone and email harassment. She subsequently tried to get a restraining order against him, which a judge denied, ordering her to stop repeating allegations of an affair or intimidation. Ellison subsequently agreed to dismiss his restraining order against her if she no longer contacted him. I'm not sure that this is nothing more than damage control just before the elections. Ellison won the primary days after the allegations were made public. Of course, accusations does not make one guilty for Ellison anymore than they do for Judge Kavanaugh. However, at least in the case of Ellison, at least one of the women were not scared about their reputation and had any political motive to call the police and file a report.
