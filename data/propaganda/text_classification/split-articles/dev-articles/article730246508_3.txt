"We have seen and heard so much from people who have shared stories about how our men impacted their lives. They will be so greatly missed, not only by us, but by everyone they touched." The statement described the fallen officers as "dedicated," both to their jobs and as their roles as fathers and husbands. "We are so sad that Eric will not see his three daughters graduate from high school. We’re devastated Tony will not be able to walk his daughter down the aisle at her wedding," the statement read. The families requested privacy and "time to heal" to mourn the loss of the officers. Morbitzer said Sunday that as the department works with the families on funeral arrangements, the police "have seen fake GoFundMe pages established already. We have had people calling our radio room screaming threats, obscenities and vulgarities at our radio techs. And quite frankly there’s a special place in hell for those people, and my wish is that it comes very soon.”
