Karen Monahan’s account in the doctor’s report is consistent with what she has been saying publicly since August: that Ellison was emotionally and physically abusive to her while the two were dating. Ellison is the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and is the Democratic nominee for Minnesota attorney general. He has adamantly denied emotionally or physically abusing Monahan. “She states that she was in a very stressful environment for years, emotional and physical abuse by a partner with whom she is now separated,” reads the November 2017 report, a picture of which Monahan posted on Twitter. “She did not have any physical injuries that required an examination in the past. She identifies the individual she was involved with as congressman Ellison, and she is worried about retribution if she identifies him publicly,” the report states. Ellison’s congressional office did not immediately return a request for comment. The Democratic Party has maintained its support for Ellison’s attorney general campaign despite the allegations. DNC Chair Tom Perez previously said the committee was “reviewing” the allegations. Perez later deferred to an investigation by the party’s Minnesota arm, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL), which endorsed Ellison’s campaign in spite of Monahan’s allegations.
