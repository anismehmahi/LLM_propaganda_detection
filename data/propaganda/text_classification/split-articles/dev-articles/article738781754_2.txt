Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Tuesday that he wanted answers about Haspel’s background running CIA torture programs prior to her confirmation. Paul contends that the Trump nominations directly contradict promises the president made on the campaign trail. “I’m perplexed by the nomination of people who love the Iraq War so much that they would advocate for a war with Iran next. I think it goes against most of the things President Trump campaigned on,” he said. The lawmaker added that he can’t support Haspel, whom he described as having expressed “joyful glee” at being involved in torture programs in the past. “I find it just amazing that anyone would consider having this woman at the head of the CIA,” Paul said. With Paul’s defection and McCain likely to be undergoing treatment for brain cancer at the time of the vote, Trump’s White House will likely be left scurrying for Democrat support to secure the majority necessary for the nominees to be confirmed in the Senate.
