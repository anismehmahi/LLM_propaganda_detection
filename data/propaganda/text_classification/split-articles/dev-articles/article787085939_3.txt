As the Free Thought Project reported on Wednesday, according to police — who continue to attempt to spin this story into some tragic mistake — Guyger accidentally went into the wrong apartment, mistook Jean for an intruder and killed him. “Guyger entered the building and walked down the fourth-floor hallway to what she thought was her apartment,” according to the arrest warrant made public Monday afternoon. “She inserted a unique door key, with an electronic chip, into the door keyhole. The door, which was slightly ajar prior to Guyger’s arrival, fully opened under the force of the key insertion.”
“Guyger drew her firearm, gave verbal commands that were ignored by … Jean,” according to the warrant. “Guyger fired her handgun two times striking [Jean] in the torso. Guyger entered the apartment, immediately called 911, requesting police and EMS, and provided first aid to … Jean. “Due to the interior darkness of the apartment, Guyger turned on the interior lights while on the phone with 911. Upon being asked where she was located by emergency dispatchers, Guyger returned to the front door to observe the address and discovered she was at the wrong apartment,” according to the arrest warrant. At no time, according to the warrant, does Guyger say what “verbal commands” she gave. What’s more, any verbal commands she did give were entirely irrelevant as she was the intruder—not Jean. Attempting to imply that Jean was somehow at fault for his own death for disobeying the commands of a homicidal cop who’d just illegally broken into his home is as irresponsible as it is reprehensible.
