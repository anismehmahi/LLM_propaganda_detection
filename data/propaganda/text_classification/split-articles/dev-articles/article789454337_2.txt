Police claim to have found a very small amount of marijuana, which they attempted to use to smear his name and somehow justify the killing. It is obvious in this case that Guyger is receiving special treatment, not only did she get away without a search, but she turned herself in at her own convenience and was let out two hours later. Not even the richest people in the country with the best lawyers would receive this type of treatment if they just admitted to killing an innocent person. There has also been controversy over the fact that Guyger has been charged with manslaughter instead of murder, which will make it possible for her to receive a much short prison sentence. As Guyger walks free awaiting her trial, the 9 people who were arrested protesting the murder and Guyger’s special treatment are still sitting behind bars. After a ceremony for Botham Jean, the protesters were arrested for obstructing traffic. Attorney Lee Merritt, who represents Botham Jean’s family, posted an update about the injustice on Twitter. I just learned the Dallas 9 will spend another night in jail for peacefully protesting brutality. Tues Officer Wiley will be tried for shooting an unarmed man 2x he wrongfully suspected of burglarizing his own car. D-9 have already spent more time in jail then he ever has. pic.twitter.com/mGHOzsN6Pp — S. Lee Merritt, Esq.
