Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams may have begrudgingly recognized her rival’s victory, but she is far from done fighting for what she believes was her due. With a team of three dozen lawyers, Abrams has announced she would file a federal suit against Georgia for “gross mismanagement” of the vote. Abrams and civil rights groups accused the winner, Republican Brian Kemp of purging thousands from voting rolls in that capacity. Abrams remained about 18,000 votes short of a result that would have required a runoff between her and Kamp in December. The Associated Press (AP) reported her team amassed nearly three-dozen lawyers who will draft a petition, along with affidavits from voters and would-be voters who argue that they were allegedly disenfranchised during the election. take our poll - story continues below Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?
