“Are you going to resist?”
The crowd shouted back their support of resisting and not submitting to the Islamization of their culture. Sharia Watch founder Anne Marie Waters also spoke at the rally. “Our leaders, our media, our police, all prioritize Islam in their decision-making,” she said. “Why is it so easy for our state to jail Tommy Robinson, when it is so difficult to jail a group of men found with an underage girl in a bedroom? Why is it so much easier to jail Tommy Robinson? “Why is it so easy to jail a man for leaving bacon at a mosque, but so difficult to jail jihadis who preach murder and death to the British people?" she continued in a line of questioning. “Why is it so easy for judges to make rulings that allow known terrorists and jihadists to stay in our country? Why is the British government allowing ISIS fighters to return from Syria and threaten our safety? “Why do we talk and investigate and get angry about an accidental fire in Grenfell, but are expected to immediately forget — or ‘not look back in anger’ — about the deliberate, ideology-driven murder of British children?" Waters went on. “And why are Muslims allowed to cover their faces with a black sack while the rest of us are subject to strict security? Why are children being mutilated and forcefully raped while the law looks the other way? Forcefully married, child married, while the law looks the other way? Why? Why are animals slaughtered in agony and terror and Halal imposed on all of us in a country that has legislated against unstunned slaughter? Why?"
