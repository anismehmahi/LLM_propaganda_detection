The affidavit says the apartments' "respective interior floorplans are in most ways identical or extremely similar." The apartment was dark and when she saw "a large silhouette," Guyger thought she was being burglarized, the affidavit says. The affidavit says Guyger drew her gun, "gave verbal commands that were ignored" and fired twice. Jean was struck once in the torso. Guyger then called 911 from her cellphone and started performing first aid. She turned on the lights, then went to the front door again and realized the apartment wasn't hers, the affidavit says. She told the 911 operator as well as responding officers that she thought she was at her apartment when she shot Jean, according to the affidavit. Ok, some of this seems plausible, but I still am left wondering about the door being ajar. Is this something people are prone to do at 1o o'clock at night in Dallas? In any case, we all know that any of us who did the same thing would have immediately been taken into custody. This was not the case with Guyger, though one officer close to her said, "she is devastated." Knowing this provoked outrage across the nation over the weekend. In fact, this is not her first shooting. As a four-year veteran of the force, she was also involved in the shooting of another suspect in 2017. The Dallas News reported:
In 2017, Guyger shot 47-year-old Uvaldo Perez, who had wrestled a Taser away from her. Another officer had been in a Pleasant Grove neighborhood looking for a woman who had a warrant out for her arrest.
