“Why is it so easy, Theresa May, to jail Tommy Robinson, but so difficult to do anything at all about the monstrous crimes committed in the name of Islam all over this country every day? Why?” Waters asked. Well, the questions are obviously rhetorical. We know why. The UK is frightened of the Islamists, and by being frightened into submission, they are being complicit in the crimes of the devout Muslims there. My speech at the #FreeTommy protest yesterday. We need answers to our questions, and we need an MP in Parliament who will ask them. https://t.co/Rxx13odSC8 — Anne Marie Waters (@AMDWaters) June 10, 2018
Kassam also spoke at the event, reminding supporters of what was happening all across Europe due the mass influx of Muslim migrants. Then he encouraged them with a piece of American history. “I’m sure we have some American friends in the crowd, on stage, and watching at home,” Kassam concluded. “You know there was a man called Paul Revere. He rode through the night on his horse. He said, ‘The British are coming, the British are coming!’ Well, let you tell you something; we’re here today to say a similar thing: The British are coming back!”
I do hope that is true, but unless the Brits are going to put the same kind of fear in their representatives that the Muslims are doing, they can't expect to do what they want to do. What Britain needs is a return to the God of their forefathers, the One Oliver Cromwell served. They need to fear Him more than they do the Islamic terrorists and rape gangs.
