Former President Bill Clinton said in an NBC interview airing Monday that he's never personally apologized to Monica Lewinsky for how their sexual affair turned her life upside down – and he doesn't owe her a mea-culpa
The former president carried on a lengthy affair with Lewinsky, often trysting with her just steps from the Oval Office

Her too: Lewinsky has emerged as an anti-bullying activist and now says Clinton engaged in a 'gross abuse of power' by seducing her
'A lot of the facts have been omitted to make the story work,' he declared, 'I think partly because they're frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office and his voters don't seem to care.' And Clinton complained in the interview that he left the presidency financially ruined because of the costs associated with the legal consequences of his actions. 'Nobody believes that I got out of that for free,' he said. 'I left the White House $16 million in debt,'
He's worth about $80 million today, aided by an aggressive schedule of speaking events – many of which paid him six-figure fees for individual appearances. In a March essay for Vanity Fair magazine, Lewinsky wrote that 'what transpired between Bill Clinton and myself was not sexual assault, although we now recognize that it constituted a gross abuse of power.' Clinton is now on a book tour with co-author James Patterson but got pointed questions from NBC in an interview that aired Monday morning

But decades later, she's still traumatized by the aftermath of being identifed globally as the your woman the President of the United States kept on the side and used for his own pleasure just a few feet from the Oval Office. 'I’m sorry to say I don’t have a definitive answer yet on the meaning of all of the events that led to the 1998 investigation,' Lewinsky wrote of the public humiliation that played out in seeming slow motion. 'I am unpacking and reprocessing what happened to me. Over and over and over again.'
