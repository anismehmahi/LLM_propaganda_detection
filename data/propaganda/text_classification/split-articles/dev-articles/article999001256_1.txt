Sore Loser: Stacey Abrams Ends Challenges In Georgia Gubernatorial Race - Won't Concede - Set To File Lawsuit

Defeated Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams finally ended her challenges on Friday and ended her challenges against Republican opponent Brian Kemp. However, in the same breath that she ended the challenges, she also declared she would be filing a federal lawsuit over what she called "gross mismanagement" of elections. If you ask me, all she's looking for here will only hurt herself and her own party. This woman wouldn't even concede! Talk about a poor sport, but Democrats are often like that in these races.
