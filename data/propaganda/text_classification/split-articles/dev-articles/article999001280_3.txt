Take, for instance, websites like MediaBiasFactCheck.com, whom I had to have my attorneys send a letter for their libel and they didn't just correct it, they removed it entirely because they knew I was two days away from filing a lawsuit against them. MBFC actually called CNN "left biased," which is correct but followed up with:
Overall, we rate CNN left biased based on story selection that often favors the left. We rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to misinformation and failed fact checks from guests and pundits. However, CNNâ€™s straight news reporting would earn a High rating for factual reporting. (5/16/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 6/15/2018)
Straight reporting? You must be kidding me? Did David Van Zandt not watch Jim Acosta lie to Anderson Cooper about this episode and Cooper just sat there and let him lie to the American people, editing the video to not even show the point of contact in question? Why yes, yes, he did! Not only that but it appears the MBFC doesn't know the documented history of CNN's complete fabrication of "news," telling stories that never happened. MBFC isn't qualified to comment on the subject. It isn't just MBFC though. Newcomer NewsGuard also covers for CNN. This is supposed to be an outlet, at least what I was told in email and phone communication, that is simply to determine transparency of websites. Instead, they not only do that, but they go on to do far more than that. In rating CNN, NewsGuard posts this nonsense.
