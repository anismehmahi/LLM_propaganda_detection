(1) A journalist called upon to ask a question will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists; (2) At the discretion of the President or other White House official taking questions, a follow-up question or questions may be permitted; and where a follow up has been allowed and asked, the questioner will then yield the floor; (3) “Yielding the floor” includes, when applicable, physically surrendering the microphone to White House staff for use by the next questioner; (4) Failure to abide by any of rules (1)-(3) may result in suspension or revocation of the journalist’s hard pass. I can see this going way downhill. If you want to deal with people like Acosta, at the moment they begin to show who and what they really are, stop calling on them for questions. This is my advice to the White House. Don't call on Jim Acosta another time for as long as he remains in the White House Press. Make him regret it the entire time he is there.
