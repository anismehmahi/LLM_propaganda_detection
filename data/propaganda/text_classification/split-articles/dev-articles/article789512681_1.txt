Cop Killer Supporter Keith Ellison Calls Cops To Protect Him From Female Journalist Armed With Mic & Camera Phone

Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) is the epitome of an effeminate man today in America. He stands accused by two women who claim that he not only verbally abused them, but physically assaulted them as well, and no, these women didn't wait decades or even till there was a politically opportune time to voice their accusations. One even had reported him to the police. Investigative journalist Laura Loomer was informed by police in Minnesota that he wanted police protection from her when he found out she was attending the education forum that was held Saturday. This is a man who follows a demonic religion, Islam, and supports cop killers. He does all of this while he stands accused of abusing women and running to be attorney general in Minnesota, even though he possesses no attorney's license that is valid. Here's Loomer's tweet from Sunday with video of her speaking to a policeman about it. take our poll - story continues below
