I'm sure NewsGuard, Yemile Bucay, Anna-Sophie Harling and Amy Westfeldt need to update this in the light of the obvious lies and editing of the Acosta video and decades of documented, outright lies and propaganda by the Clown News Network, but you can't expect real transparency from an outlet like Newsguard whose writers aren't transparent about their own political bias, can you? Nope, you can't, and you can't expect it when some of those writers write for other publications that don't measure up to NewsGuard's standards either. The reason this little incident shouldn't be let go of so soon is that it is one of the clearest demonstrations of the media's bias, which we all have, lies and propaganda. It should be used over and over in article after article to remind people about the total dishonesty and complete disregard for reporting the facts by outlets such as CNN and to not blindly trust self-proclaimed fact-checkers who will not tell you the truth either. CNN has lost its mind to the point that they are suing over Acosta losing his press pass. He was their inside boy, after all. But the real irony here is that the media labeled Paul Joseph Watson and Infowars as "conspiracy theorists" and yet, PJW has exposed their blatant conspiracy to smear President Trump, Sarah Sanders and the White House aide. And Jim Acosta believes he and CNN deal with facts and Infowars doesn't. Yeah, right! I'm sorry Jim, I can't hear you over the booming voice of your hypocrisy!
