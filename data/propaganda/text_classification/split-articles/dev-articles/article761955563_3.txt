The court heard the pair launched a political campaign in which they claimed to be trying to expose Muslim men who were the subject of a rape trial. So, expose the Islamists fro who and what they are and what Islam's founder not only taught them, but modeled for them, and you may just find yourself in jail in the UK. Sadly, the same scenario is making some strides in the US, as well. Free Tommy Robinson protests are set for this weekend, and Dutch MP Geert Wilders has said he will join those protests. Wilders has called Robinson's imprisonment a "disgrace." He told Breitbart:
Tommy Robinson was arrested on May 25 outside Leeds Crown Court after using social media to broadcast details of an ongoing trial which was subject to reporting restrictions. He was arrested, brought before a judge, and sentenced within five hours. The judge ordered a media ban on his arrest and imprisonment, even forcing British publications to delete their articles about the case. Such measures are common practice in North Korea and Saudi Arabia. It is sad to see how Britain, the cradle of Western democracy and the rule of law, is fast descending into tyranny. Tommy is a hero. It is a disgrace that he is still in jail. I have been invited to a major protest demonstration in London next week, and I will be coming. Free Tommy now. Indeed! Free Tommy Robinson now!
