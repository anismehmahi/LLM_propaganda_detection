You know that isn't going to stop someone like Acosta, who claimed to deal in facts and truth, but clearly demonstrated he was all about lies when it came to putting his hands on a White House aide. The order by Judge Kelly is a temporary one that lasts for 14 days. “I will say this, look, nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do and if I think somebody is acting out of sorts I will leave," Trump continued. "I will say thank you very much everybody, I appreciate you coming and I’ll leave. And those reporters will not be too friendly to whoever it is that’s acting up.”
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement following the judge's ruling on Thursday. “Today, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House. In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter’s hard pass. We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future. There must be decorum at the White House.”
Well, I can't wait to see the next press conference. Perhaps there is an easier way around all of this. Perhaps from now on, President Trump should ignore Jim Acosta and take anyone and everyone else's questions in the room but his questions. See how he likes them apples.
