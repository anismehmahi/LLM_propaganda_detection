When the officer thought he saw the woman in a car with two men in the 8300 block of Reva Street, the officer asked for backup from Guyger and another officer, according to an affidavit. One of the officers was trying to search Perez when he became combative, the affidavit said. Guyger deployed her Taser before Perez was able to take it from her. After Perez had the Taser, Guyger fired her gun once, striking him in the abdomen, the affidavit said. Neither Guyger nor the other officers were injured in the 2017 shooting. Police arrested Perez on a charge of taking a weapon from an officer, as well as charges for possession of methamphetamine, marijuana and violating his parole. In February 2018, Perez signed a plea agreement for the charge of taking an officer's weapon and was sentenced to two years in prison. The Texas Rangers are also involved in the investigation. USA Today reports that Guyger was freed on bail on Sunday after being charged with manslaughter, and faces two 20-year sentences and up to a $10,000 fine. A charge of murder may be forthcoming once the case is taken to a grand jury, according to Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson.
