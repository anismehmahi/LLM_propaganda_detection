Not Surprising: Now Fox News Is Supporting CNN & Jim Acosta

Fox News is largely controlled opposition despite what many may think. They have a couple of people that actually are conservative. Other than that, they have liberals and neo-cons running rampant. Many were surprised to discover that Fox News not only is supporting lying CNN and lying Jim Acosta, but they are even going so far as to file an amicus brief with the US district court over the White House's revoking of Acosta's press pass. One would think these people would understand that this is not a First Amendment issue. If it were, they wouldn't have to apply for a White House press pass. This is a privilege issue and it seems that Acosta wore out his welcome with his attacks on Sarah Sanders, being belligerent during his time asking a question(s) of President Donald Trump, and his pushing aside a White House aide who simply tried to remove the microphone from him. Trump was right, Acosta is a "rude, terrible person." take our poll - story continues below
