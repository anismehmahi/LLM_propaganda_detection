As state officials prepare to certify the vote, Abrams acknowledged the law “allows no further viable remedy” to extend her quest to be the nation’s first black female governor. But she laced her speech with biting criticism of Kemp, who she accused of leveraging his role as the state’s top elections official to suppress voters. “I will not concede,” she added, “because the erosion of our democracy is not right.”
You mean like having a sister waiting in the wings of any campaign lawsuits, Ms. Abrams? What about invalid provisional ballots getting mixed in with valid ones? Maybe a little electronic voter manipulation, Ms. Abrams? How about non-citizens and illegal aliens voting, Ms. Abrams? Are these evidence of the erosion of the democratic process? Sure they are and they appear to all be coming from the party that Stacey Abrams represents, but she's not going to talk about that. But she wasn't going to concede. Nope, that arrogant wanna-be first female governor of Georgia simply would not bow out gracefully. “To watch an elected official who claims to represent the people in this state baldly pin his hopes for election on the suppression of the people’s democratic right to vote has been truly appalling,” Abrams said. “So, let’s be clear," she continued. "This is not a speech of concession. Because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper. As a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that. But my assessment is the law currently allows no further viable remedy.”
No, concession means "a thing that is granted, especially in response to demands; a thing conceded." Abrams was easily defeated in terms of votes.
