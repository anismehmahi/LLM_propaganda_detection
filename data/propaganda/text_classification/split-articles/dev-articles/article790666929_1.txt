Star Tribune Sues To Unseal Accused Serial Woman Abuser Keith Ellison's Divorce Records

Flashback in 2004, when up until then, Barack Obama couldn’t win an election. But during his 2004 campaign for the Senate, Obama and his corrupt party in Chicago somehow managed to unseal the divorce records of his opponent Jack Ryan, who was leading by a large margin. The Ryan divorce records were sealed at their mutual request of both Mr. and Mrs. Ryan. But the Democrat machine got them unsealed anyway. Barack Obama’s backers emailed reporters about the divorce controversy. The divorce records were not pretty. Ryan resigned. Obama took the field. Different rules for the lawless party.
