Here are a few things you can do:
Subscribe to the newsletters of websites you enjoy. Don’t count on seeing their work on social media. (You can subscribe to my newsletter here, incidentally.) Support them financially if you can. Many sites have Patreon accounts or donate buttons
Bookmark them and visit regularly – if they have ads, your visits help them to make the money they need to stay afloat. Share their articles on your own social media accounts. If they can’t get their work out there, we can help. Join alternative social media outlets like Gab and MeWe. The truth is getting harder and harder to find. You’re going to have to dig for it. We’re watching the biggest campaign against freedom of speech and thought that has ever occurred in our part of the world. The alternative media purge is just the beginning. And we should all be very concerned. Article posted with permission from Daisy Luther
