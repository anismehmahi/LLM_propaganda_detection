His supporters continuously tried to block Loomer, even trying to put their hands on her, cover up her camera and getting in her way of asking honest answers that Ellison owes the people whom he is asking to vote for him. Loomer asked why the police were called to Amy Alexander's house in 2005 over domestic violence. Ellison was in a relationship with Alexander at that time, but has denied the allegations. He fails, however, to relay his side of the story. However, 911 call documents show that Alexander named Ellison as her assaulter. #MnAg ——> RT @jpkolb: UPDATE: This is a record of a 911 call from May 16, 2005.
