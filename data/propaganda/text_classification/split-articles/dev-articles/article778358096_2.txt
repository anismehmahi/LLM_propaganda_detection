The imam said he did not know the cause of death. "Whoever is responsible, then that person should be held accountable," Wahhaj said. A Georgia arrest warrant accused the boy's father, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, the imam's son, of kidnapping the child. Authorities said the father at some point told his wife he wanted to perform an exorcism on the boy, who cannot walk, suffers seizures and requires constant attention because of a lack of oxygen and blood flow at birth. The imam said he was unaware of the training of the children for school shootings, but his mosque has been known to attract Islamic jihadis over the years. "It sounds to me it sounds crazy. But I don't know," he said. "I make no judgments yet because we don't know." Again Fox adds, "The imam's mosque has attracted a number of radicals over the years, including a man who later helped bomb the World Trade Center in 1993." Mosque spokesman Ali Abdul-Karim Judan claims that the narrative is being changed because Muslims are involved and that this was nothing more than a "domestic situation." "None of the charges had anything to do with anybody teaching anybody shooting to commit acts of terrorism or to go in and shoot up any school," he said. "Because it's a Muslim and the circumstances that are surrounding their situation, they want to change the narrative." Eleven children were found in terrible conditions in that compound. That's hardly a "domestic situation."
