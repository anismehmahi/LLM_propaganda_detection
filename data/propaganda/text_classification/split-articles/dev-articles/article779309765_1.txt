Unbelievable! Sharia New Mexico: Islamic compound jihadis RELEASED on bond after charges of “Islamophobia” and “racism” (Islam is not a race)

Editor's Note: Talk about injustice! There were remains of a 4-year-old boy found there, who allegedly died while they were performing some sort of Islamic ritual over him. The Bundys and their supporters got nearly two years in jail and no one hurt a single person! Shame on those who are supposed to uphold law and justice! Shame! Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe testified that they found children holding boxes of ammunition, and that one child was found with a gun…. Because sharia trumps dead children, school shooting training, kidnapping and jihad training. The children discovered at an “extremist Muslim” compound in New Mexico earlier this month were both trained to use firearms and taught multiple tactical techniques in order to kill teachers, law enforcement and other institution…. state prosecutors said on Monday. take our poll - story continues below
