"And if he misbehaves, we’ll throw him out or we’ll stop the news conference," Trump said. Acosta’s hard pass was pulled after a contentious Nov. 7 press conference at the White House. After interacting with President Trump – Acosta said he wanted to “challenge” him on calling the Central American caravans an “invasion” – the president called upon another reporter to speak. After lecturing Trump, Acosta belligerently refused to yield the microphone to a White House staffer and pushed her arm away as she reached for the device, all of which was captured on video. On Nov. 16, U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly of Washington, D.C., who was appointed by Trump, ruled against the administration and ordered Acosta’s hard pass restored for 14 days, pending further hearings in the lawsuit. But it was not a vindication of Acosta’s free speech rights under the First Amendment. The judge specifically said that the First Amendment claim made by Acosta and CNN had not yet been adjudicated and added that the president was free not to call on Acosta at future press conferences. The temporary restraining order was nowhere to be found online at press time, but according to media reports, Kelly found that the administration violated Acosta’s due process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. The White House vowed to remedy the situation by drawing up rules governing press conferences. The U.S. Department of Justice said the court ruling was disappointing.
