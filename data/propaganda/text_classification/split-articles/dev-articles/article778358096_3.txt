Furthermore, as I reported on Wednesday, both the Associated Press and the Atlanta Constitution-Journal reported on the training. The documents claim Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and his co-defendants conducted weapons training at the camp where they were found Friday with 11 children in allegedly “third world” conditions. Wahhaj is also wanted in Clayton County in a child abduction case involving his missing son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj. The documents, which suggest all the adults were involved in the training, say a person serving as a foster parent caring for one of the kids revealed the details about the training.

People can continue to put their heads in the sand all they want to because they know "nice" Muslim people, but the fact of the matter is that the history of Islam is anything but nice, polite, just or holy . It is a totalitarian, religious/political construct that is full of oppression. When you have those that actually believe the Koran and follow in the footsteps of the desert nomad Muhammad , then you will not find radicals, but devout Muslims. This appears to be exactly what Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and others arrested at the compound are. In either case, it is very sad that a little boy lost his life, possibly at the hands of his Islamic father and others. Justice should be served swift, and I don't mean a lengthy jail term.
