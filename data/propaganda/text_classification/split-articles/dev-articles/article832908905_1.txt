Mueller report: No further indictments

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s much-anticipated final report on his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election has been delivered to Attorney General William Barr. A senior Justice Department official said the report does not recommend any further indictments. Trump has maintained that he and his campaign did not collude with Russia during the 2016 campaign. His attorneys said Friday he expects the report will exonerate him. Barr has said he will write his own account of Mueller’s findings and communicate it to Congress and the American public. In a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, Barr wrote he “may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.”
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted Friday afternoon: “The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr, and we look forward to the process taking its course. The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel’s report.”
Barr, in his letter to congressional leaders, said Mueller’s investigation was conducted properly. The attorney general said he was required to inform congressional leaders if Mueller had done anything “inappropriate or unwarranted.”
“There were no such instances during the Special Counsel’s investigation,” Barr wrote. Trump’s personal lawyers, Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, issued a statement.
