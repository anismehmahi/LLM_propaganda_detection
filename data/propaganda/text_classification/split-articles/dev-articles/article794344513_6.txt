While it may seem bleak for now, we will rise from the ashes of the social media dinosaurs to help build and create new platforms that are out of their control where ideas of peace and freedom can be discussed openly without fear of devoting years to a platform that can disappear you in the blink of an eye. If you are not on our email list, please sign up here. If youâ€™d like to subscribe to our site to aid in the battle against the censors and receive special perks along the way, you can do so at this link. We are also working with the folks from minds.com and have created a platform on their uncensored network as well. You can follow us at this link. We have been on Steemit as well. And Instagram too.
