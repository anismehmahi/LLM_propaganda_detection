Mueller Submits His Russia Report to Justice Department

Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded his 22-month Russia investigation and submitted a report to Attorney General William Barr on Friday, triggering a clamor from Congress to see the findings. A Justice Department official told the Associated Press that Mueller is not recommending any further indictments. In a letter to the heads of the Senate and House judiciary committees, Barr described Mueller’s submission as a “confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions he has reached.”
“I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” the letter said. Barr did not detail what the report contains, but did say that the Justice Department did not overrule any decision Mueller made. Barr said he will consult with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has mostly overseen the Special Counsel’s Office, about “what other information from the report” can be released to Congress and the public. The White House and President Trump’s lawyers said the next decisions are up to Barr. There is a possibility that Barr releases two separate reports. One would summarize Mueller’s findings without including classified information and would be given to Congress—and would then most likely find its way out into the public.
