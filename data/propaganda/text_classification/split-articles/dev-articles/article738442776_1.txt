Yikes! Even John McCain is worried about Trump’s CIA pick

Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. After President Donald Trump nominated Gina Haspel to head the Central Intelligence Agency Tuesday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Americans need answers about her past involvement in state sponsored torture programs. As I noted earlier today, Haspel’s long career at the CIA spanned the years of torture carried out under the George W. Bush White House. A 2013 Washington Post report on the new CIA head called her role in the torture programs of that era “extensive” and noted that at one point she ran a CIA “black site” in Thailand where torture occurred. In a lengthy statement following Haspel’s nomination, McCain expressed big concerns about what it means for the agency’s future, saying:
During his own confirmation proceedings for Director of the CIA, Mike Pompeo repeatedly committed that he would comply with the law that applies the Army Field Manual’s interrogation requirements to all U.S. agencies, including the CIA. The American people now deserve the same assurances from Gina Haspel, whose career with the agency has intersected with the program of so-called ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ on a number of occasions. The torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history.
