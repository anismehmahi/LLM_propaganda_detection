In the court documents, authorities said a foster parent of one of the 11 children removed from the compound had told authorities the child had been trained to use an assault rifle in preparation for a school shooting. Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe previously said adults at the compound were "considered extremist of the Muslim belief." He did not elaborate, saying it was part of the investigation. CBS News has learned Wednesday that Wahhaj is the son of a Brooklyn imam who was a possible co-conspirator in the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 -- but was never charged. The elder Wahhaj heads the Masjid At-Taqwa, a mosque that has attracted radical speakers over the years. Wahhaj met Mahmud Abouhalima when he came to the site to raise money for Muslims in Afghanistan.
