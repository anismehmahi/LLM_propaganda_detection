“Islamophobia” is a thought crushing device designed to silence any and critics and criticism of Islam. It is the tool in which the ummah enforces sharia blasphemy laws in the West. Waco – the Feds killed ’em all. Shot it up and burned it down. Fast forward to Islam in America —
New Mexico compound jihadis released on bond after charges of racism and “Islamophobia” “THEIR LAWYER ARGUED THAT THERE WAS A DOUBLE STANDARD IN THE CASE BECAUSE HIS CLIENTS WERE MUSLIMS. HE ARGUED THAT IF THEY HAD BEEN CHRISTIAN AND WHITE, ‘WE MIGHT NOT BE HERE TODAY.’” Bu Jihad Watch, August 13, 2018: Seriously? If they had been Christian and white, stockpiling weapons and plotting school shootings, with the ringleader being the son of one of the most respected Christian preachers in the country, there wouldn’t have been news coverage of anything else for weeks. There would have been feature stories in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. CNN and MSNBC would be running special reports on toxic Christianity and the crisis in the churches. This incident, on the other hand, received very little coverage, and hardly any that touched on the Islamic aspects of the story. But Muslim claims of victimhood are so polished and reflexive by now, and the Leftist acceptance of them so matter-of-fact and instinctive, that Judge Sarah Backus fell right into line. We can only hope that no one dies because of her folly.
