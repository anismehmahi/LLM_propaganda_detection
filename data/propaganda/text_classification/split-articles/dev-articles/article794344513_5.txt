Serving as a kick in the teeth to the thousands of people who lost their livelihoods yesterday because of this purge is the fact that pages who do set out to deliberately deceive people, put out actual fake news, and slander others — like the infamous Your News Wire — remain intact and able to post. No, we are not calling for these fake pages to be removed, but instead using it as a point of reference as to why they targeted us when pages like YNW have become famous for spreading lies and deceiving people. Those who demanded Facebook & other Silicon Valley giants censor political content - something they didn't actually want to do - are finding that content that they themselves support & like end up being repressed. That's what has happened to every censorship advocate in history: https://t.co/IZHF8GVkgC — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 12, 2018
Indeed, we have reached the precipice of corporate-state censorship. Those who have constantly demanded that tech giants silence their critics and information that ‘offends’ them are finally seeing the inevitable results of such irresponsible acts. As we have been pointing out for the last two years, tech monopolies large enough to silence those with whom you disagree, are large enough to one day silence you. The silver lining to this massive purge of independent media is that it signals the beginning of the end of censored media. TFTP has been planning for this day and we have been growing our email list and our subscriber base. We will not be silenced.
