Hey, Self Proclaimed "Fact Checkers" and Mainstream Media, Let's Not Let That Jim Acosta Propaganda You're Putting Out Go So Fast! Notice how quickly the drive-by media and self-proclaimed "fact checkers" gunned down the Trump administration and Infowars with their lying propaganda over the video that was enhanced, not doctored, to demonstrate that all of them and Jim Acosta are lying through their Communist teeth? Yep, I noticed too, and now they're trying to move on, but I'm gonna get in one last bit before we do. Of course, Infowars' Paul Joseph Watson simply enhanced the video from C-SPAN, which was a gif image (motion picture), in order to show the point of contact that the lying media and "fact checkers" said didn't occur. Watson then went on to be happy that President Trump backed him up on his comments about the video. Take a look, and as always, PJW is hilarious in his presentation. If they're prepared to lie this shamelessly, what else are they lying about? take our poll - story continues below Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?
