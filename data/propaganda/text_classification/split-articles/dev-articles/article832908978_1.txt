Trump Kept Asking Friends If the Mueller Report Would Drop This Week

On Wednesday, Donald Trump was flying to a military tank plant in Lima, Ohio, to deliver a speech on the economy, but, as is frequently the case, the president had something more pressing on his mind. While aboard Air Force One, the president killed some time by picking up the phone and ringing associates to ask them if they thought Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report would be sent to the Department of Justice this week, according to a source with knowledge of these conversations. The report, which would mark the culmination of Mueller and his team’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential obstruction of justice, has for many months kicked off round after round of speculation among the media and political class about when, exactly, it will finally be delivered to the Justice Department. This week, the President of the United States himself joined in on the anxious anticipation and the Mueller report guessing game. According to three knowledgeable sources, Trump has quizzed various people—administration officials, friends, his legal team—throughout the week if they believed the buzz that the Mueller report could be delivered as soon as this week. The president, these sources said, speculated on when he thought it would finally happen, repeatedly citing news reports from this week on a possible imminent delivery.
