NBC News spoke with Jean’s mother in a phone interview from her home in St. Lucia who was stunned to hear of his death. “He did no one any wrong,” she said. While the Free Thought Project consistently reports on police officers entering the wrong home during raids and killing, maiming, or traumatizing entirely innocent people, this is the first time we’ve reported a story of an off-duty cop going into the wrong home, on their way home, and killing someone. The details of how or why this officer would walk into an apartment that was not hers are unclear. However, what is entirely clear is the fact that a mother and father are now and will be grieving for the rest of their lives because of her actions. And, in a slap to the face of Jean’s parents, the person who admitted to killing their innocent son has yet to be arrested. Article posted with permission from The Free Thought Project
