Court orders White House to restore CNN correspondent Jim Acosta’s press credential

CNN has won the first round of its legal battle to get correspondent Jim Acosta back in the White House. U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly granted the cable news network’s request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction Friday that restored Acosta’s White House press credential. Kelly ordered that Acosta be reinstated immediately. He did not rule on CNN’s claim that the revocation of the journalist’s pass violated his rights under the First Amendment. But he said the White House did not provide Acosta with due process to legally remove his pass. The ruling followed a court hearing held Wednesday in Washington, where lawyers for CNN and the White House faced off over the issue of press access. CNN had the broad support of other news organizations that believed the White House’s actions posed a challenge to press freedom. “We are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days,” a CNN representative said in a statement. “Our sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.”
The White House said it would abide by Kelly’s ruling. “Today, the court made clear there is no absolute right to access the White House. In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter’s hard pass,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.
