Wilburn became the first cop in 41 years — since officer Darrell Cain murdered a 12-year-old boy in the back of his squad car — to be indicted for shooting a suspect. Also in 2013, officer Cardan Spencer shot a mentally ill man in his driveway. Days later, he was also fired after surveillance video proved he was lying about what happened. So why hasn’t the chief fired Gugyer, who has actually been charged, arrested, and admitted to killing an innocent man? Like all those accused of a crime, Amber Guyger deserves her day in court. However, as far as her job with the department is concerned, she has already proven that she is no longer fit for duty, ever again. WFAA asked the Dallas Police Department for the laws she cited claiming that she can’t fire Guyger, but they did not provide them. The department did respond about the general order mentioned by WFAA, however, saying, “General order 508 refers to the Police Chief’s ability to circumvent the formal disciplinary procedures not the investigative process.”
Exactly what “investigative process” needs to happen before they can fire her remains unclear as this public servant admitted to killing an innocent man in his own home. At the very least, she should be fired for this. But then again, as we’ve reported already this week, Amber Guyger is subject to a different set of rules than common citizens, which apparently includes keeping a paycheck after admitting to killing an unarmed, innocent, pillar of society, Botham Jean.
