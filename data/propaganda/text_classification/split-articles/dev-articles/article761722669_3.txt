Clinton is launching a book tour to promote 'The President is Missing,' a fictional political thriller co-written with the famed author James Patterson. He accused interviewed Craig Melvin of 'ignor[ing] gaping facts in describing this, and I bet you don't know you don't know them.' 'This was litigated 20 years ago. Two-thirds of the American people sided with me.' Lewinsky is pictured on September 21, 1998 meeting with then-president Bill Clinton at a White House function
If he were president today, he said later, his most famous extramarital affair wouldn't 'be an issue, because people would be using the facts instead of the imagined facts.' Patterson, too, defended Clinton â€“ by comparing his sexual affairs in office with those of two preceding Democratic presidents. 'It's 20 years ago, come on!' he blasted Melvin. 'Let's talk about JFK. Let's talk about, you know, LBJ. Stop already!' Clinton piled on. 'You think President Kennedy should have resigned? Do you believe President Johnson should have resigned? Someone should ask you these questions because of the way you formulate the questions,' he jabbed. 'I dealt with it 20 years ago, plus.' Suddenly philosophical and seeming to take a longer view of history, Clinton said: 'I have tried to do a good job since then with my life and with my work. That's all I have to say to you.'
