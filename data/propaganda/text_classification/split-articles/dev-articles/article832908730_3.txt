Several witnesses, for example, have been questioned about other countries’ efforts to meddle in American politics, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, the UAE and Qatar. So far, the Special Counsel’s Office has indicted or obtained guilty pleas from 34 people and three companies. Six of those are former Trump associates, and 25 of them are Russians. No Americans have been charged with conspiring with Russians to meddle in the 2016 elections—at least none the public knows about. But major Trumpworld figures were charged with a variety of other crimes, including former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, deputy campaign chairman Richard Gates and Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen. Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison for crimes he committed while working for Trump, including the payments he made to two adult film star actresses for their alleged affairs with his boss. Manafort was sentenced in both Virginia and in Washington and will serve about seven years in prison. In Washington, Manafort was sentenced for for conspiring against the U.S. and a conspiracy to obstruct justice connected to his covert lobbying on behalf of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. He was sentenced in Virginia for bank and wire fraud. The Special Counsel’s Office said in a court filing last week that it had gotten all it can out of Flynn, who has been cooperating for months after pleading guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.
