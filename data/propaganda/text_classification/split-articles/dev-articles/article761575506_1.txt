Bill Clinton: 'Public apology to Monica Lewinsky was enough'

'I felt terrible then and I came to grips with it.' Former President Bill Clinton said his public apology for his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky was enough. NBC’s “Today” show correspondent Craig Melvin asked Clinton in an interview aired Monday if he had ever apologized to Lewinsky, who was 22 and Clinton’s subordinate when they began an affair more than two decades ago. “I apologized to everybody in the world,” Clinton said of his public apology. Melvin followed up by asking Clinton if he had ever apologized privately. “I have never talked to her. But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry. That’s very different. The apology was public,” he said. Clinton made his public apology in 1998 during the National Prayer Breakfast. צילום: Reuters Clinton whispers to first lady Hillary Clinton during White House event
