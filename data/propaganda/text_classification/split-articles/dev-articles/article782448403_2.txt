“The Court finds that the irreparable burdens on the private defendants’ First Amendment rights are dwarfed by the irreparable harms the States are likely to suffer if the existing restrictions are withdrawn and that, overall, the public interest strongly supports maintaining the status quo through the pendency of this litigation,” Lasnik wrote in his decision. — Patrick McGreevy

©2018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. The radical leftist gun grabbing anti-liberty California General Xavier Becerra is lying when he says the “Trump Administration inexplicably gave the green light to distribute on the internet blueprints of 3D-printed, untraceable ghost guns.” The Department of Just(Us) settled a 1st Amendment claim filed by Cody Wilson, who created the code for 3-D guns. It was a case the government was about to lose. The settlement was approved by a federal judge. Becerra’s statement, “it needlessly endangered our children, our loved ones and our men and women in law enforcement,” is preposterous left-wing political argle-bargle. I suspect the Washington judge’s stay will be overturned on appeal, but certainly will if it makes it to the Supreme Court. The federal government has no standing to restrict speech in this manner. –BL
