Officer Guyger was terminated for her actions. She was hired in November 2013 and was assigned to the Southeast Patrol Division. Under civil service rules, Officer Guyger has the right to appeal her discipline. This move is noteworthy as the department has been standing up against those who have been calling for the officer to be fired. As recently as Friday, Hall refused to fire Guyger, saying in part, “There is one overriding reason that I have not taken any administrative or employment action against Officer Amber Guyger. I don’t want to interfere with the on-going criminal investigation into her actions.”
Also, in a town hall meeting last week, Hall again stood behind her choice to refuse to fire Guyger, claiming it would be against the law. “I can’t do that because there are both local, state and federal laws that prohibit me from taking action. There are civil service laws we have to adhere to,” said Hall. Apparently, it is no longer against the law. This news will likely be well received by the Jean family as well as the activists who have been calling for justice for Botham since the beginning. As TFTP previously reported, the idea of not firing Guyger seemed utterly preposterous as she admitted to doing something wrong. While controversy swarms the case of why she may have killed Jean, there is no doubt that she did kill him. This is a fact. This public servant walked into an innocent man’s home and shot him dead. Because of her actions, this man no longer lives. This alone should have been enough to fire her.
