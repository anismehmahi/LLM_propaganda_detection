“The President has broad authority to regulate access to the White House, including to ensure fair and orderly White House events and press conferences. We look forward to continuing to defend the White House's lawful actions." Acosta ignorantly blathered on to reporters when he returned to the White House Friday after the court ruling, incorrectly claiming he won a great First Amendment victory. "I'm very grateful for what happened today," Acosta said. "I'm grateful for my colleagues in the press who stood by us through all of this." "This was a test and I think we passed the test," he said. "Journalists need to know that in this country their First Amendment rights of freedom of the press are sacred, they're protected in our Constitution," Acosta said. "Throughout all of this I was confident and I thought that this would be the result at the end of the day that our rights would be protected as we continue to cover our government and hold our leaders accountable." The court case isn’t over yet. The legal antagonists have to report to the court Monday afternoon. The court ordered the parties to “file a joint status report proposing how they would like to proceed in this case by 3:00 p.m. on November 19, 2018[,]” according to its online docket. According to CNN, “White House officials sent Acosta a letter stating that his pass is set to be suspended again once the restraining order expires.”
From the looks of the letter, the W.H. is trying to establish a paper trail that will empower the administration to boot Acosta again at the end of the month.
