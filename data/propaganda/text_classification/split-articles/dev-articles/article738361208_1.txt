Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook

Following what has appeared for months to be a strained relationship between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the top diplomat is being replaced. Trump announced Tillerson’s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: “Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!”
This is yet another big shake-up for Trump’s still-young administration — and it may be the most important one to date. The move creates some big questions about both the administration’s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president’s relationship with the deep state. If you enjoyed Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State, you’ll like Pompeo’s. Like Clinton and her Democrat allies, Pompeo has long subscribed to the belief that Russia is perpetually meddling in U.S. affairs. In fact, he believes Barack Obama got Russian help too. While he was being confirmed as CIA chief, the former lawmaker lashed out at Russia for reasserting ” itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe, and doing nearly nothing to aid in the destruction and defeat of ISIS.”
Again, if you liked Obama-era, world-on-fire, Russians everywhere State Department shenanigans, this is your guy.
