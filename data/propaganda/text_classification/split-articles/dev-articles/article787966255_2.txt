One of the most glaring instances showing her privilege was the fact that the Texas Rangers said in their report that Jean refused to obey Guyger’s “verbal commands.” Had anyone else but a cop walked into an apartment and killed an innocent man, do you believe that investigators would have said anything like this? Attorney Stephen Le Brocq, who operates a law firm in the North Texas area sums up the treatment of Guyger perfectly when he says that “The affidavit isn’t written objectively, not at the slightest. As stated before, they are usually wholly against the accused. An objective view of the information related by the officer would be proper, in my opinion. This affidavit states facts based upon the word of the person it seeks to accuse of criminal wrongdoing.”
What’s more, according to WFAA, who obtained affidavits for all of the search warrants involved in the case, none of them involved the search of Guyger’s apartment. For those who don’t recall, police egregiously released the search warrant findings of Jean’s apartment on the day his family buried his dead body. They attempted to assassinate Jean’s character by claiming they found less than a half ounce of weed in his apartment. However, they failed miserably at it. One thing in particular, however, stood out to those paying attention and that is the fact the police didn’t release any information on what they found in Guyger’s apartment. According to the information currently available, that’s because they didn’t search it. According to WFAA, there were five search warrants issued in the case—none of which were for the killer’s apartment. As WFAA reports:
Two of the warrants allowed investigators to remove the front door of Guyger and Jean’s apartment, their door locks and to download data for their door locks.
