“The officer responsible for the completely unjustifiable shooting death of O’Shea Terry has been returned to light duty and has faced no criminal charges whatsoever. The officer who shot and killed Botham Jean remains on the Dallas police force and was able to bond out on manslaughter charges in a fraction of the time the protestors have spent in jail,” Merritt said in a statement. Merrit cast suspicion on the police for intentionally keeping these protestors in jail to send a message and make an example out of them. The reaction from the police, in this case, has shown that they believe they have a license to kill and that they cannot be trusted to monitor themselves and keep one another in check. They have no interest in serving justice when it comes to enforcing crimes against their own. Article posted with permission from John Vibes.
