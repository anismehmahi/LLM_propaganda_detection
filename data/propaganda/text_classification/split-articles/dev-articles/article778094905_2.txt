The documents claim Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and his co-defendants conducted weapons training at the camp where they were found Friday with 11 children in allegedly “third world” conditions. Wahhaj is also wanted in Clayton County in a child abduction case involving his missing son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj. The documents, which suggest all the adults were involved in the training, say a person serving as a foster parent caring for one of the kids revealed the details about the training. The Associated Press confirms the report:

That's not all. A young boy's body was discovered at the site as well. AJC reports:
Siraj Wahhaj learned Wednesday that prosecutors want him held without bond, along with his relatives also arrested at the compound: Lucas Allen Morton, Jany Leveille, Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj. Siraj Wahhaj is also accused by Clayton County authorities of abducting his son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, in December. Authorities are working to determine if the remains of a young boy found near the compound Monday are Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj’s. Monday was (or would’ve been) the child’s 4th birthday. The court filing says the remains were in a state of decomposition. #Breaking: A child's remains were discovered on the compound. Deputies do not have a positive ID. So it is too early to say if it Abdul-Ghani Wahajj who would have celebrated his 4th birthday yesterday. https://t.co/e1RQbzDY8y — Ashley Homrich (@AshleyNewsATL) August 7, 2018
