America's Immigration Voice. Earlier, I blogged that the police had released the name of the suspect in the murder of two white Westerville, OH cops (Quentin Lamar Smith) but no picture had appeared. I found the picture at right on a Mugshots site, attributed to a guy with the same name, in the same town. ( Most people named Quentin Lamar Smith are black, by the way.) Police charge suspect in death of two Westerville Police officers Quentin Lamar Smith was charged with two counts of aggravated murder on Sunday By WCMH Staff and The Associated Press Published: February 11, 2018, 4:45 pm Updated: February 11, 2018, 6:02 pm WESTERVILLE, OH (WCMH/AP) — The Westerville Division of Police has identified the suspect in the shooting death of two police officers as 30-year-old Quentin Lamar Smith. Westerville Police Chief Joe Morbitzer said officer Eric Joering, 39, died at the scene and his colleague, Anthony Morelli, 54, died at a local hospital. Smith was charged with two counts of aggravated murder on Sunday. Morbitzer said the officers were responding to a “potential domestic situation.” A neighbor who heard the gunfire said it happened at a home where the occupants were “always arguing and fighting.” “The officers gave their lives in defense of others,” Morbitzer said during a news conference, struggling to keep his emotions in check. He called them “true American heroes.” The Columbus Police Department is investigating the shootings.
