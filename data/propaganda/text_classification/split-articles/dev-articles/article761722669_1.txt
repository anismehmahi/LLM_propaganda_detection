Bill Clinton insists he doesn't owe Monica Lewinsky an apology

Former President Bill Clinton insisted in a weekend interview that he doesn't owe a personal apology to Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern whose adult life has been defined by their inappropriate sexual affair and the global scrutiny that followed. 'No,' he told NBC in an interview airing Monday on the 'Today' show. 'I do not â€“ I have never talked to her. But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry.' 'I apologized to everybody in the world,' Clinton said, implying that was enough. And the flustered former president, more famous for his Don Juan-like seductions than for his policy legacy, portrayed himself, not Lewinsky, as history's victim in the mass-media's retelling of the 1990s saga.
