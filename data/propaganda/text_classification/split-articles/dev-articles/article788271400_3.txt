Calling for Gugyer to be fired is not the same as calling for people to be fired for making stupid Instagram posts or saying stupid things—she killed an innocent man. At the very least, she should be fired from her job which gave her the gun to do it. What Ted Cruz is doing is the same thing the police and their apologists are doing. They are treating Guyger differently because she is part of the system. In Cruz’s eyes, Guyger going into an apartment that wasn’t her’s and killing an innocent man was simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time—a tragic mistake that ruined two lives, according to Cruz. But that is not the case at all. Would Ted Cruz and police officers be following this same narrative if the roles were reversed? If it was Botham Jean, a black man, walking into the apartment of Amber Guyger, a white female cop, and killing her—would police and Ted Cruz simply write it off as a tragic accident? Of course, we know the answer to that question and it is a resounding, NO. To shut down the peanut gallery before it begins, this is not some case of Democrat versus Republican or right versus left. This is a case of right versus wrong, and what Amber Guyger did to Botham Jean was wrong. There is no other way around it, “mistake” or not. From the start of this case, law enforcement have set out to protect Guyger because she is part of their blue line. Amber Guyger’s home was never searched while Jean’s apartment was searched that night.
