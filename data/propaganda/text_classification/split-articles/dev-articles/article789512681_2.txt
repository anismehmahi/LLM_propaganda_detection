THAT IS WHY the police were there. üëáüèª pic.twitter.com/ABIvsJNW4d ‚Äî Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) September 23, 2018
On Saturday, there was an education panel at the Education Minnesota Apple Valley open to union members and guests. Prior to the event, Ellison's campaign called police to ensure that he was "protected" from a woman armed with a mic and camera phone . Loomer peppered him with questions about the alleged abuse at a State Attorney General debate Friday night. She stood alongside other female survivors of abuse. Ellison not only claimed the women were lying but then fled the scene. At least he said something there, which is more than I can say for his response earlier in September when Loomer confronted him at another event with questions. Failing to answer, Ellison tried to move from person to person, allowing his minions to try and provide cover for him, similar to that of Maxine Waters, but there was no "member's only" elevator to flee into.
