She was the one trying to "find" and count votes remember? She is the one claiming there was cancellation of hundreds of thousands of voter registrations. Where is her evidence? She has none. Stacey Abrams is a sore loser just like Hillary Clinton and this little temper tantrum she put on display will probably sink any chances she may have had in the future to run again. Good! Thank God, Georgia didn't elect this peach.
