Even now, u r willing to say my son is lying and have me continue to leak more text and info just so others will believe him â€” Karen Monahan (@KarenMonahan01) August 12, 2018

Even one woman in the Loomer video says, why are they waiting till now to bring this forward? Well, for Ms. Monahan, perhaps that could be asked, but not for Amy Alexander. That report was filed more than a decade ago. It appears that with Ms. Monahan's claims and Keith Ellison's unwillingness to address the public with his side of the story that perhaps, he has not changed his ways at all.
