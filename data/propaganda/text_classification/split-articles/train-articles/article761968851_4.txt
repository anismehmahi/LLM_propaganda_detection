The labor-force participation rate (LPR), a sign of worker confidence and mobility, rose by 0.6 points for immigrants and was unchanged for native-born Americans. At 65.3%, the immigrant LPR this December was considerably above the native-born American rate (61.9%.) ADVANTAGE IMMIGRANTS
The number of unemployed Americans fell by 763,000—down 12.7%, while the number of unemployed immigrants fell 129,000—down by 11%.
