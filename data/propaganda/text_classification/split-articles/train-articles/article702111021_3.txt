“ICE decided that the most orderly way for him to depart was for us to remove him,” Stevens said. Saris expressed a dim view of that move. “The government broke a promise,” Saris said. “That’s the thing I‘m concerned about here.” U.S. Judge Wrestles With Issue Of Indonesian Immigrants, by Scott Malone, Reuters, October 20, 2017
However, the law is quite clear, the United States has the authority to detain illegal aliens; T itle 8 of the United States Code, Section 1226, Arrest And Detention Of Aliens , gives such authority to the Executive Branch.And despite her realization that she has no authority over immigration policy, or that she will just be overruled, Saris again reaches, basing her assumption of authority over immigration based on the past Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty , when illegal aliens weren't deported.Kritarch Saris is in the wrong on both counts; she has neither authority over the detention of illegal aliens nor any authority to continue the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty. She is like Derrick Kahala Watson , a treasonous kritarch, unwilling to submit her hunger for power and ideology to the Constitution and the law. Impeachment for her and Watson is the solution.
