THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS OF TRUMP'S IRAN INITIATIVE

Originally published the Jerusalem Post. On Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran. No, in his speech decertifying Iran’s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn’t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism. Trump’s move was not operational. It was directional. In his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran. For the first time since 2009, when Obama backed the murderous regime in Tehran, spurning the millions of Iranians who rose up in the Green Revolution, Trump opened up the possibility that the US may begin to base its policies toward Iran on reality. Trump began his remarks by setting out Iran’s long rap sheet of aggression against America. Starting with the US embassy seizure and hostage crisis, Trump described Iran’s crimes and acts of war against America in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did. Trump’s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime’s repression of its own people.
