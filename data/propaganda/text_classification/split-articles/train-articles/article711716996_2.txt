In the United States, these Chinese went through the liberal asylum process, but did not manage to fool even the credulous "judges" at the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the immigration courts. Fast forward to the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty , where despite outstanding deportation orders, these illegal aliens, among millions of others, are allowed to remain, and then given employment authorization as well. Fortunately, elections have consequences, and the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty, or parts of it, came to an inglorious end. And end it was for this particular lot of illegal aliens. But Kritarch Patti Saris was having none of the immigration laws of the United States. She thought she was decider-in-chief on who gets deported. And all on the flimsy excuse that the aliens need another bite at the apple, despite the clear fact that the Indonesian government had long ago quashed the ethnic riots directed against the market dominant minority of Chinese and the religious motivated violence against Christians. While there are a couple of provinces in Indonesia that impose Sharia law on Muslims, most non-Muslims are exempt. As moderates go, Indonesia is about as close as it gets to moderate Muslims. Mostly because the country would not last long without an outside high IQ elite to run the country. Before it was the high IQ Dutch, now it's the Chinese. Remember, an 87 IQ is just about retarded.
