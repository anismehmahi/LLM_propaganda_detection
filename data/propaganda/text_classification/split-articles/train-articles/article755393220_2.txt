It was widely reported that the MEK was behind the anti-government violence that erupted in Iran in January which snowballed into the situation today. Hersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including former CIA directors James Woolsey and Porter Goss; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. For over a decade, Bolton has been calling for regime change in Iran. Now, he’s the National Security Advisor.

The behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself.
