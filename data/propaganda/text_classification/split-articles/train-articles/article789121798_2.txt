The most suspicious part of this whole situation is the timing. Christine Ford recalled the incident in 2006
She's known about this for over ten years, why come forward now? She's affiliated with the democratic party and the “resist” movement
She hired a Clinton attorney, Lisa Banks
She can produce exactly zero witnesses
Any one of these (and dozens of other) circumstances by themselves are not enough to dismiss this allegation outright. However, taken together as a whole, it’s far too suspicious to lend it any credibility. Ladies, you demand to be believed, no matter what. Well, when every time there's a man that you don't like running for public office or being nominated for a position, some woman crawls out from a line of protesters and makes an ambiguous-at-best claim about unwanted sexual advances, it becomes increasingly difficult to take you seriously. No, an accusation against a man who has been investigated by the FBI six times prior and has 75 women publicly vouching for his character is not going to stop this process.
