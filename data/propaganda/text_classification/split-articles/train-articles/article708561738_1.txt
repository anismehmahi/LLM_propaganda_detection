How Do You Like Paying For Sexual Harassment Settlements from Your Congress, America? How Do You Like Paying For Sexual Harassment Settlements from Your Congress, America? Please help support us with cryptocurrency donations. Thank you! We finally have the official numbers, and they arenâ€™t pretty. Reid Wilson, a correspondent for the Hill, has posted to Twitter a year by year breakdown of sexual harassment settlements and awards that he received from the Congressional Office of Compliance. I went ahead and added up each column, and what I discovered is that 264 cases of sexual harassment in Congress have been settled since 1997, and the total amount awarded in those settlements comes to a grand total of $17,250,854. So where has the $17,250,854 come from to pay those settlements? That money has come from the taxpayers of course. That means that you and I have been paying to cover up the epidemic of sexual harassment that has been taking place on Capitol Hill. When U.S. Representative Jackie Speier originally told us that more than 15 million dollars had been paid out to victims of sexual harassment in recent years, I was envisioning a few dozen cases at most. I had no idea that the total number of cases would actually be well over 200.
