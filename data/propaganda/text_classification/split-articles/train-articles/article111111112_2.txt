The UK should never become a stage for inflammatory speakers who promote hate." EDL leader Tommy Robinson, meanwhile, criticised the decision and said Ms Geller and Mr Spencer were coming to the UK to lay flowers at the place where Drummer Rigby died. "It's embarrassing for this so-called land of democracy and freedom of speech," he said. "How many hate preachers are living in this country? It just shows what sort of a two-tier system we have here." 'Foster hatred'
Anti-fascism campaigners Hope Not Hate had campaigned for the pair to not be allowed into the UK. A researcher with the organisation, Matthew Collins, said it was "delighted" with the decision. "These two are among some of the most extreme anti-Muslim activists in the world. They've nothing to contribute to life in this country. "They're not here to contribute to good community relations. They only wanted to come here and help the EDL stir up more trouble. Britain doesn't need more hate even just for a few days." Mr Spencer put up a copy of what appears to be the exclusion decision from the Home Office on the Jihad Watch website, while Ms Geller posted a copy of her letter on her website, Atlas Shrugs. The letters, both dated Tuesday, claim that both activists have fallen within the scope of a list of unacceptable behaviours by making statements which may "foster hatred" and lead to "inter-community violence" in the UK.
