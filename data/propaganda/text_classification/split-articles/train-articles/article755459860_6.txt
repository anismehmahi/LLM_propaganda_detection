“Absent a change in government within Iran, America will face a choice between accepting a nuclear-armed Iran or acting to destroy as much of this capability as possible.”
President Trump did made clear earlier in the week that we must make efforts to differentiate between the people of Iran and its ruling regime. Well, I agree, but that gets real messy when you start intervening in this manner. “Any public discussion of these options, and any messaging about the Iranian regime in general, should make a bright line distinction between the theocratic regime along with its organs of oppression and the general populace,” according to the plan. “We must constantly reinforce our support for removing the iron sandal from the necks of the people to allow them the freedom they deserve.”
But the Trump administration has spoken out on other countries where the people want their independence. Remember the Kurds? How about the people in the Catalan region of Spain? No support for those people, and why? Cause it's not part of the agenda. I say if the Iranian people want their freedom, let them first free themselves from the bondage of Islam, and then let the passion that burns inside men to be free rise up as it did in our forefathers due to the teachings fo the Holy Scriptures and stand and fight. Then, they will be in a position to ask for aid, but only then.
