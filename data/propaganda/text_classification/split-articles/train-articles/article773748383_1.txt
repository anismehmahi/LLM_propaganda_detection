The Goal Of Eliminating Guns Is Ultimately A Fool’s Errand

It is said that the DOJ's recent settlement with start-up company Defense Distributed (DD) essentially deals a death blow to gun control advocates. DD, based in Austin, TX, was founded by 25-year-old Cody Wilson in 2013. The company's main product is a "gun fabricator" called the Ghost Gunner. With nothing but the Ghost Gunner, an internet connection, and some raw materials, anyone, anywhere can make an unmarked, untraceable gun in their home or garage. The settlement states that 3D printing tutorials are approved “for public release (i.e. unlimited distribution) in any form.”
Wilson created a ruckus in May 2013 when he announced his successful design of a plastic gun. In just two days, 100,000 copies of the handgun blueprint were downloaded from Wilson’s website. take our poll - story continues below
