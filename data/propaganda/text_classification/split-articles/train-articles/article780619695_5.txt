Turn over the documents secret archives involving predation, both in the Vatican and in the chanceries around the globe. That is the only expression that will demonstrate concern for the young. Sign the Petition to Stop the Synod Here. Editor's Note: The Remnant has lunched its own #StopTheSynod petition, for those who would rather not go to Change.org. Our petition will remain at the top of our site from now until October, or until the Synod is canceled. Please sign and encourage your friends, contacts, and social media associates to do the same.
