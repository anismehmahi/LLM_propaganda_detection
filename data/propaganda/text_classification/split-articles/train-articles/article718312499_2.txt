The flashes which are not consistent with FAA required running lights in any way can be seen starting at 0:19 seconds into the video. Note: To see the flashes you must view the video on ‘1080p’ and set it to ‘full screen’ and look between the two hotels (adjust the video speed to 25%.) The exact same aircraft and apparent muzzles flashes can also be seen in the Arch Angel Studios “First Shots” video which was posted to YouTube on Oct. 2, just one day after the shooting. #LasVegasShooting
