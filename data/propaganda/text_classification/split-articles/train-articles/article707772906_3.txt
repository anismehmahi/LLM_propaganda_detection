But just because he was a comedian does not mean that he gets to play by a different set of rules. There appears to be an ongoing pattern of behavior, and Fox News has documented some of the other incidents that have come up in the past…
Franken, then a comedian, was quoted in a 1995 New York Magazine article discussing a skit for “Saturday Night Live” that involved drugging and raping CBS reporter Lesley Stahl. Franken, at the time a writer for “SNL,” suggested one skit should play out with “60 Minutes” commentator Andy Rooney finding an empty pill bottle on his desk. “’I give the pills to Lesley Stahl. Then when Lesley is passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her.’ Or ‘That’s why you never see Lesley until February.’ Or, ‘When she passes out. I put her in various positions and take pictures of her,’” Franken was quoted saying. The article, along with a 2000 Playboy column in which Franken talked about fantasizing a machine would perform oral sex on him, was used to attack Franken during his 2008 Senate campaign in Minnesota. As much as we may be appalled by some of the things that Al Franken has done, the truth is that there are far worse offenders in Washington. Let’s talk about Bill Clinton for a moment. Democrats have been covering up his sexual crimes for years, and my hope is that now this will start to change.
