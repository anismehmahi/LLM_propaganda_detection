"At that time, he had some things, I thought, he had to offer." Ellison then concluded, "He made it very clear in the early 90s that his views and mine were absolutely incompatible, and I’ve been saying that ever since.”
Keith, you're lying. It's clear from video evidence that Ellison and fellow Democrat Gregory Meeks had dinner with Farrakhan and Iranian leader President Hassan Rouhani in 2013. Take a look for yourself and understand how pathological liar and accused woman abuser Keith Ellison seeks to deceive you. In case you missed it, here's a still frame of Ellison just a few feet away from a man who has called on 10,000 blacks to stalk and murder white people. Both of these men have the same devil as their father because both men are following after the teaching of the Koran . One of them just actually has the nerve to say it. The other doesn't. Maybe Ellison is attempting to pull an Obama. Remember when Obama's "pastor," Jeremiah Wright uttered "God damn, America!"? Obama tried to say he had been in that church for years and never heard such things, which isn't true. Ellison is attempting to do that same. However, as Michael Ahrens of GOP.com tweeted, Ellison knew what kind of man Farrakhan was then and what kind of man he still is today.
