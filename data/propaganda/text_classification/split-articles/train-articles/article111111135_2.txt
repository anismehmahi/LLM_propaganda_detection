Their reluctance to condemn Mr. Farrakhan has led to criticism from across the ideological spectrum this week. What is the Nation of Islam? The Nation of Islam is a political and religious movement that was started by W.D. Fard Muhammad in 1931 and continued by Elijah Muhammad in 1933. It first became prominent after a man named Malcolm Little joined the organization. Encouraged by Elijah Muhammad, he changed his last name to X and became a minister in the movement. Edward E. Curtis IV, the author of “Black Muslim Religion in the Nation of Islam,” said that while estimates ranged wildly about how many bona fide members belonged to the Nation, he believes that there were tens of thousands of members in the 1960s and early 1970s. But he said that millions of others sympathized with the movement’s anticolonial stance and were inspired by its most famous member, Muhammad Ali. Who is Louis Farrakhan? Born Louis Eugene Walcott in New York in 1933, Mr. Farrakhan joined the Nation of Islam in the mid-1950s and rose quickly within the organization, becoming close to Malcolm X. After the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, he became one of the most powerful members of the Nation and its chief spokesman, the position that Malcolm X had held. The Nation of Islam had gained followers around the nation in the 1940s and ’50s by providing something of a religious answer to antiblack racism. It was not widely recognized as an anti-Jewish organization during its early years (its early literature, though, focused on “the white man” as “the white devil”).
