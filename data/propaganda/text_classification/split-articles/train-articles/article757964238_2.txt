As long as Dwight and Steven Hammond remain in jail for what is obviously a gross miscarriage of justice, this matter remains a blight on the federal regulatory agencies and the criminal justice system. Rural communities of the West are greatly appreciative of the efforts of the Trump administration to restore the economies of these communities. We respectfully ask President Trump to pardon Dwight and Steven Hammond. I completely agree with that assessment and fully support President Trump pardoning these men. They are the furthest thing from terrorists. They are hard-working, family ranchers who simply were doing their job. I've written on the Hammond's case in several articles, which you can view below. Many of you followed these stories when the mainstream wouldn't cover them. Many of you followed Bundy Ranch until after the trials, but when we asked for people to step up and sign a petition to bring Bundy Ranch prosecutor Steven Myhre to justice for his crimes, we couldn't get 1,000 signatures. Please, put yourself in the position of these humble ranchers and consider if you would appreciate someone simply taking the time to put their name on a petition to which the President of the united States might have to respond to by setting these men free. Consider that and then, please, support the petition by clicking here.
