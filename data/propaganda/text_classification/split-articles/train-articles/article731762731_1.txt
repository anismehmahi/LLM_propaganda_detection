Cardinal O’Malley will head revived Vatican abuse panel

Cardinal Sean O’Malley has been reappointed as the head of a Vatican commission on child sex abuse, as Pope Francis on Saturday revived the panel in the wake of widespread condemnation last month of the pontiff’s defense of a Chilean bishop accused of witnessing and ignoring abuse. The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors lapsed in December, when its members’ terms expired, prompting concerns that the advisory body could be disbanded. In addition to O’Malley’s return as the panel’s president, Pope Francis named seven returning members and nine new members representing countries around the world, including Brazil, the Netherlands, Ethiopia, and India, according to a statement from the Vatican.

Some members are themselves survivors of abuse, according to the statement, but they were not identified to protect their privacy. Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

O’Malley, the archbishop of Boston, said in the statement that the pope had “given much prayerful consideration” to the membership of the panel. “The newly appointed members will add to the Commission’s global perspective in the protection of minors and vulnerable adults,” he said.
