Police have not released many details about the way the events transpired, but did say that Smith had injuries and was transported from the home. Authorities had responded to the house as recently as three weeks ago for a reported disturbance, records obtained by the Enquirer showed. At the time, the home's residents told police that there was nothing amiss. Smith’s wife had told police in November that her husband illegally carried a “gun all of the time,” according to the Enquirer. Smith was convicted of burglary in 2008, barring him for possessing a firearm. Authorities have not released which type of gun was used in the shooting.
