In Wake Of Elections, Migrant Caravan Resumes March Towards US Border

Of course, the news of the migrant caravan has largely been abandoned due to the elections and what appears to be voter fraud and election meddling and manipulation across the country, but that doesn't mean that thousands of migrants from Central America have abandoned their quest to enter our country illegally. Despite barbed wires and thousands of troops on the border, they have been undeterred. A report from RT tells the tale:
The Central American migrant caravan has just begun another leg of their journey to the US border hastily reinforced by the Army and Marine Corps. The migrants previously made a days-long stop in Mexico City. The caravan, made up mostly of Hondurans, but also nationals of other Central American countries, is now on the move towards the United States border. Migrants resumed their march north on Saturday morning after spending almost a week in Mexico City. take our poll - story continues below Should Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?
