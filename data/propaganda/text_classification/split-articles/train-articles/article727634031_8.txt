Seller's reaction to massacre: 'Revulsion'
Victor said police found his client's name and address on a box that Paddock had -- a box that Haig gave him to carry the tracer rounds he had bought. Haig said he learned of the massacre when authorities contacted him at work the next morning. "Revulsion," Haig said of his reaction. "Sickness. Horror that this man would do something like that." Haig spoke with investigators four times after the shooting, and has been "fully cooperative," Victor said. "This was a routine transaction to purchase a routine type of ammunition that is available in many different retail outlets throughout the state of Arizona," Victor said. "After that transaction, Doug had absolutely no further contact with Mr. Paddock." Death threats
Haig said he's received death threats since the search warrant documents were released Tuesday. "One woman (was) screaming through my door that I should be killed and I should die," he told reporters at Friday's news conference. "It's been not a lot of fun, quite frankly." Haig added, "I had no contribution to what Paddock did. I had no way to see into his mind." Haig named as person of interest
A Nevada judge on Tuesday unsealed police search warrant records -- prepared shortly after the shooting -- that mentioned two persons of interest in the case. The judge released the documents after CNN and other media outlets sued to obtain them. One person of interest, whom police had named previously, was the killer's girlfriend, Marilou Danley. Authorities subsequently cleared her publicly. The second name was redacted.
