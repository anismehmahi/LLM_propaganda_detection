She said that she did her research on me and said that the media really attacked me. I responded with, "Of course they did, and of course they still do." They are being exposed for who they are and they do not like it. (John 15:22). I told her that there are too many counterfeits, self-proclaimed leaders, out there who care more about saving face, than they do the souls of men (Luke 19:10), as well as saving their country. Apparently they have a reputation to keep up. Philippians 2:7-9
These are those that sit behind the status of some sort of church or political leader of the pack. Yet, you do not see any warfare or opposition around them and why? because they have simply forsaken the cross. There is no absolutes with these people. They are people pleasers and nothing more. After all you can always tell what a man stands for by the enemies that he has. They hide behind a microphone day after day. Yet, they fail to confront the issues that needed to be confronted. The reason they don't is because they are guilty of what they fail to confront! They are paper tigers. They can write all big and bad but when it comes to what someone else should do. However, when it is time for them to put boots on the ground, they are simply missing in action (MIA). These are willing to live in the freest country in the world as long as it is not them that have to sacrifice to maintain it.
