Now, President Trump has gone along with it. My guess is that one of two things will occur with the FBI investigation: (1) Absolutely nothing will be found, and this will have been a huge waste of time or (2) look for this thing to expand and the need will arise to make this more of a circus than it already is, which will dwarf anything Clarence Thomas had to face from the slanderous accusations of Anita Hill. Remember, whether you like Judge Kavanaugh or not, this has been nothing but a political hit.
