Homeschooling Protects Children from Violence and Marxism

The February mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida prompted many parents to consider homeschooling.

Many potential homeschooling parents are concerned about the failure of school administrators to effectively protect children from bullying by other students.

Other parents are motivated by a desire to protect their children from the cultural Marxism that has infiltrated many schools. take our poll - story continues below
