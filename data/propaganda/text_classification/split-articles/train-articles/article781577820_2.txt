“However, no nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States.”
That last statement comes amid nearly constant complaints from Trump that Justice Department and FBI investigators are being unfair to the president and his allies. That line of criticism has been picked up by, among others, Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who was indicted on federal officials this week on charges of misusing campaign finance funds for personal use. Trump did not directly answer a Fox News interviewer’s question about whether he intends to fire Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing the special counsel investigation, after November’s congressional elections. He also said he only gave the former senator the job because Sessions was a supporter during the 2016 presidential race. — John T. Bennett
