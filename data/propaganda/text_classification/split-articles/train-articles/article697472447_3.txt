Campos heard a drilling sound and thought it was odd. A maintenance worker came up to the 32nd floor. As the pair started talking, Paddock began firing through the door of his room, first with a single-fire gun and then with a rapid-fire rifle. Police have said that when Campos radioed what happened, it helped them track where Paddock was holed up â€“ so why change the narrative to make it even more unbelievable? And still, none of this explains why Campos is not registered as a security guard either, and why the timeline is being changed publically. What exactly do they want us to believe?
