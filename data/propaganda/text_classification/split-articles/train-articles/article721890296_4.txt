And while Orban is right that these are 'economic migrants,' they are also 'Muslim invaders.'" "They don’t want a 'German life' in Germany in the sense that they are willing to accept German values," she added. "Many, all too many, of them want to overwhelm German values, and European values in general, with sharia values. They are in Europe to conquer and Islamize it, with willing and eager help from Europe’s short-sighted, self-serving, internationalist intelligentsia." Indeed! Thank you Prime Minister Orban for saying what needed to be said!
