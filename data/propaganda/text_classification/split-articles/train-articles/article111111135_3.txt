But in 1967, it became outspokenly and flagrantly anti-Zionist, in an expression of solidarity with Palestinians. That political position became a vehicle for Mr. Farrakhan to express his anti-Semitism. (Among his more infamous comments is his 1984 description of Adolf Hitler as “a very great man.”)

In 1975, when Elijah Muhammad died, the Nation split into two factions. The faction reconstituted under Mr. Farrakhan in the late 1970s retained the original name, though not the influence or support that it had when its leaders were Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali and Elijah Muhammad. Mr. Curtis said that today the membership could be in the thousands, and there could even be as many as 10,000 followers. Mr. Farrakhan, whose name, the Anti-Defamation League wrote after the February event, is “virtually synonymous with anti-Semitism,” then drew national attention in 1984, when he exhorted his followers to support Jesse Jackson’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. In a radio address, he urged listeners to “make an example” of a Washington Post reporter who had reported that Mr. Jackson had used anti-Semitic terms in private. Mr. Jackson repudiated Mr. Farrakhan, but the minister’s support proved troublesome to his 1988 campaign as well. He was back in the news in 1995 when he organized what became known as the “Million Man March,” a political and religious revival event in Washington. Why were Tamika Mallory and Danny Davis reluctant to denounce him?
