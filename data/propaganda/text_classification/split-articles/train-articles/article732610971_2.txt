In speaking of the influx of Muslim migrants into Europe, Orban sees it as destroying the culture of Europe and referred to it as an “immigrant zone, a mixed population world that heads in a direction different from ours.”
Orban then called out the traitors in the midst of Europe who want to push Hungary to accept Muslim invaders. “Absurd as it may sound the danger we face comes from the West, from politicians in Brussels, Berlin and Paris,” he told the crowd to applause. “Of course we will fight, and use ever stronger legal tools. The first is our ‘Stop Soros’ law.”
Orban has seen the influence of George Soros and his organizations in Hungary and has openly criticized it and Soros, calling Soros a "public enemy." He also said that Soros has "ruined" millions of lives via his "mafia network." Reuters adds:
Soros, for his part, compared Orban unfavorably to both the Nazis and the Communists, saying his rule evoked dark tones from the 1930’s — when Hungary was allied with Nazi Germany — and was more oppressive than Cold War Soviet occupation. Orban has tightened the screws on non-government organizations, particularly ones funded by Soros, and attempted to close a prominent Soros-founded university. Attributing to Soros a recent United Nations plan on creating a global blueprint to handle the migration crisis, Orban said he anticipated that powerful allies would help him prevent the U.N. from greasing the wheels of migration. “Soros has antagonized not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too,” Orban said. “Everywhere he wants to get migration accepted. It won’t work. We are not alone and we will fight together … and we will succeed.”
“We don’t think the fight is hopeless, on the contrary, we are winning,” Orban said.
