She told a town hall that “local, state and federal laws prohibit me from taking action,” according to ABC affiliate WFAA. Two days later, the Dallas Morning News reported that police could fire Guyger but did not plan to review her employment until a criminal investigation wrapped up — probably months away. In a statement, Hall said that any disciplinary investigation would risk compromising the criminal case. “That is not a risk I am willing to take,” she said. Police did not explain what changed by Monday, when the department announced that an internal-affairs investigation had been launched and already “concluded” that Guyger’s arrest was a fireable offense. The officer, who was hired in late 2013, was terminated during a hearing Monday morning “for her actions.”

The statement notes that Guyger can appeal her firing. Police did not comment on whether Hall is still worried that the termination might affect the criminal investigation. As Paul wrote for The Post, the more significant legal questions are whether Guyger is prosecuted as a police officer or civilian and whether a jury decides she acted reasonably in using deadly force.
