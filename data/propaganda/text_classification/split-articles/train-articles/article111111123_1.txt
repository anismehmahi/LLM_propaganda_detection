Domestic abuse allegations against Keith Ellison cannot be substantiated, Dems' lawyer says

A lawyer hired by Minnesota Democrats says she is unable to substantiate the accusations of domestic abuse against Rep. Keith Ellison because the lawmaker’s ex-girlfriend refused to provide video of the incident - but the findings are still being turned over to law enforcement. The Associated Press on Monday reported that it obtained a draft of a report written by Susan Ellingstad, a lawyer hired by Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party to investigate the claim against Ellison. "The investigation report, which was released today without our knowledge by someone outside of our organization, was unable to substantiate the claim of physical abuse made by Ms. Monahan,” DFL Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement. Martin said they planned to turn over the report to local law enforcement. “For the purpose of objectivity and getting all of the facts regarding these allegations, we have decided to forward the information in the investigation to local authorities in order to let them review the contents and determine whether further investigation is warranted,” Martin said. The Democratic congressman, who serves as deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has denied the allegations. In a statement, Ellison thanked Ellingstad for conducting a "thorough, independent, and fair review."
