Supporting Local Efforts to Reduce and Combat Gun Crimes, including: Opposing concealed carry reciprocity policies and legislation that would circumvent city policies established to protect residents;
Providing local governments and law enforcement officials access to ATF gun trace data;
Opposing "Stand Your Ground" or "Shoot First" laws and urging state legislatures that have adopted such laws to repeal them; and
Encouraging mayors to take executive actions to combat gun violence and illegal use and trafficking of guns; Protecting Young People, including: Opposing proposals to allow teachers and other non-law enforcement, non-security personnel to carry firearms in K-12 schools;
Raising the youth handgun ban from 18 to 21 years of age;
Banning juvenile possession of semiautomatic assault rifles; and Holding gun owners criminally liable when children gain access to improperly stored guns. Protecting Domestic Violence Victims, including:
Prohibiting persons convicted of domestic violence crimes or subject to final domestic violence restraining orders from acquiring or possessing firearms; and
Requiring prohibited domestic abusers to turn in firearms they already own;
How any of this is consistent with support for the Second Amendment is anyone's guess. I think they throw that language in to cover for the fact that they are attacking it head on and attacking the rights of the people. How does any of this stop gun violence? It doesn't. What it does do is infringe on the rights of teachers, law-abiding citizens who want to purchase several guns which they will use lawfully, sides with criminals against law-abiding citizens as it opposes stand your ground and other measures written specifically to protect people who would normally be victims of crime. Banning semi-automatic weapons doesn't stop crime either, as we've pointed out before, and the statistics are available for anyone to see that gun violence didn't go down one bit during the decade of the Clinton/Feinstein assault weapons ban. These geniuses also "Support Enactment of Comprehensive Background Checks, Ban the Sale of Bump Stocks and Related Devices and Prevent the Arming of Teachers in Schools." Again, this will do nothing to stop criminals with guns. Why? Because they won't follow your unconstitutional and unlawful laws in the first place!
