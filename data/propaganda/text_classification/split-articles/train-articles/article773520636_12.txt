And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.”
Over and over again, you can see that the Church was to stand in protest against the wicked that were at war with Christ (Revelation 12:17), in dealing with not only the corrupt and wicked priests, but also the corrupt and wicked in government. as well as those who submitted to such. It is important for people to know the Scriptures (History), lest you find yourselves to be fighting against God (Acts 5:39). Nowhere in Scripture can you find the Lord telling His children to submit to the wicked in disobedience to His Word. Nowhere! Furthermore, the individual that wrote the article teaching people to submit to authorities might want to take the time to read Romans 12:21 before perverting and twisting Romans 13, so that the next time he will not be guilty of twisting Scripture the way that Satan twists Scripture. “Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.”
