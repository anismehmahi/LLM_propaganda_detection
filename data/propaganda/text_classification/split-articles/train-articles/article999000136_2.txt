When asked whether that would be important for voters to know that or not, Smith said, “That’s not for them to know.”
Of course, anyone following what Gillum has been promoting knows he isn't planning on delivering just like many politicians. “So, let’s go back to Mr. Gillum’s platform, right?” said Smith. “Raise the corporate tax in Florida from 7 to 11 percent. That will never happen. Raise teacher’s pay to $50,000, that will never happen. Give me another position. Medicare for all, that will never happen.”
What's even more amazing, but not surprising, is that Gillum has claimed that his opponent is a racist, but the video demonstrates the utter racism of Smith, which one can then conclude that Gillum knows about Smith's racism and keeps him on staff anyway. “This is a f***ed up state,” said Smith. “It’s a cracker state.”
Smith also stated that the campaign has “to appeal to white guilt.”
Good luck with that! It gets worse though. Smith says that Gillum is “a progressive” who is “a part of the crazy, crazy, crazies.”
NEW: The honesty of Gillum's campaign staff on undercover video is refreshing, especially when it comes to who the real Andrew Gillum is. While trying to appear as a moderate, "Gillum is a Progressive" and "He is a part of the crazy, crazy, crazies."

OK, we know that, but if that is true, what sort of useful idiot is Smith? A pretty big one if you ask me. Gillum is not a lawful man as he does not support the right to keep and bear arms, but rather considers Americans as criminals who need to prove their innocence before obtaining a gun.
