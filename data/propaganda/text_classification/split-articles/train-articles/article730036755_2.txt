Four minutes later, someone, presumably a police officer, tells a dispatcher: "We have two officers down. Child on couch, one at gunpoint." It's unclear at what point Smith was shot. Other 911 calls show that Candace Smith was hiding in bushes in front of the home, pleading for help because her daughter is still inside the home while a dispatcher calmly tells her to stay there. "Please help," Candace Smith repeats several times in a call at 12:14 p.m. "He shot the police officers." Westerville police had gone to the couple's townhome for domestic disputes three times since September of last year. Joering and Morelli's names aren't listed on those calls. On Sept. 14, police responded to a call from Candace Smith that her husband was drunk and doing something to her car. A brief narrative from the officers says, "No dispute or argument." Candace Smith told officers they were separating, and that he left when she told him she was calling police.
