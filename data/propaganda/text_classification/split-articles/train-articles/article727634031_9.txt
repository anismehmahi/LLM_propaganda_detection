But the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported it had a version of the search warrant that named, without redaction, Haig as that second person. The documents didn't explain why he was a person of interest. Las Vegas police officials told CNN the department couldn't comment on Haig or any names, and referred questions to federal authorities. Sheriff has said feds were investigating someone
When the search warrant documents were released this week, Clark County District Court Judge Elissa Cadish allowed a small portion of those records to be redacted because "there is an ongoing investigation regarding charges against another individual, arising out of information obtained in connection with the ... shooting, but not directly related to the shooting." In response to a question from CNN in January, the Clark County sheriff, Joe Lombardo, said federal authorities are investigating a person in the case. That person could face federal charges not directly related to the shooting within the next 60 days, the sheriff said January 19. Lombardo didn't disclose the person's name, saying those details were "under federal grand jury disclosure" rules. On Friday morning, before his arrest, Haig answered a reporter's question about whether he believed he was that person. "No. I don't think it's me at all," Haig said.
