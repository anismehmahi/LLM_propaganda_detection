“So, obviously more than one member of Congress.”
If members of Congress are engaged in this type of behavior, why don’t the American people know about it? And why are those members of Congress still allowed to serve? Representative Barbara Comstock also testified on Tuesday. She said that one current member of Congress exposed his private parts to a female staffer when she delivered papers to his house…
Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) said at a House Administration Committee hearing on Tuesday that a sitting member of the U.S. Congress exposed himself to a young female staffer who delivered papers to his house–at his request. We need to be told who this member of Congress is so that he can be removed from Congress immediately. This kind of behavior is not acceptable for anyone in a civilized society – and that goes double for someone that is supposed to be one of the leaders of our nation. Here are the exact words that Comstock used as she described this incident…
This member asked a staffer to bring them over some materials, to their residence. And the young staffer — it was a young woman — went there and was greeted with a member in a towel. It was a male, who then invited her in. And at that point, he decided to expose himself. She left, and then she quit her job. She left, she found another job. Of course, this sort of behavior is not just limited to members of Congress.
