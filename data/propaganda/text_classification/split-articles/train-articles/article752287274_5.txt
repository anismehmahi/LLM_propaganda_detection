“I don’t want to get myself in a lawsuit over this.”
In court, Bacon badgered Hadeed. “Are you going to share any more info with them? I hope not. I hope you learned that lesson,” he said. “You have no control over [Gilani], do you? You’re like, talking to a wall,” he said of Gilani. Hadeed said three different signatures from Abid on financial documents did not match, and put a defiant Abid on the witness stand. Hadeed: Why do your signatures look different? Abid: My signatures are not very consistent, I’m just a human being…
Hadeed: You were aware you were changing beneficiary from your father’s spouse to yourself? Abid: That was my father’s request…
Hadeed: You’re not answering the question. Abid: I’m not very smart, so it takes a while sometimes…
Judge: I don’t understand why the witness is having such trouble with the question. Your job is to answer the question. In court documents, Gilani alleged, “while he was admitted in hospital my telephone conversations were taped and some other recording devices were also installed/planted in my house … Imran Awan showed up and threatened me for me calling the police. [Imran] threatened that he is very powerful and if I ever call the police again [he] will do harm to me.” She said that Imran eventually agreed to remove the listening devices and did so in front of her.
