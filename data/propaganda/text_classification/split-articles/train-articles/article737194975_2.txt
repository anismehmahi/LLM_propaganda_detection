Florida School Massacre Proves Police Are Worthless In Protecting Us
Well, Trump’s statements are now the rallying cry for gun grabbers all over America to enact gun confiscation laws. So far, five states have passed “red flag” laws that allow police agencies to confiscate guns from someone deemed to be “dangerous” by either a law enforcement officer or a family member BEFORE the individual has committed any crime, and in one State (Rhode Island) the governor issued an executive order implementing a “red flag” law. Here are the six states where the legislatures have already passed—or the governor has already issued an executive order implementing—“red flag” laws:
California
Connecticut
Indiana
Oregon
Washington
Rhode Island
And since Trump’s Stalinist statements, there are at least 24 additional states that are currently considering passing “red flag” laws. These are:
Alabama
Alaska
Arizona
Delaware
Florida
Hawaii
Illinois
Iowa
Kansas
Kentucky
Maryland
Massachusetts
Michigan
Minnesota
Missouri
New Jersey
New York
North Carolina
Ohio
Pennsylvania
Tennessee
Utah
Vermont
Virginia
And it’s not taking long for law enforcement agencies in the above states to begin their Naziesque assault on gun owners. This report is from Seattle:Doubtless, many other states are also considering passing “red flag” laws.
