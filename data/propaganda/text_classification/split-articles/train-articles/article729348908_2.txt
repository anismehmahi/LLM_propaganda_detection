Jordanian officials moved for Patel's deportation. On Sept. 2, 2016, he boarded a flight to Chicago, and the next day, he flew to Detroit. There, he met an FBI source and started talking about the Islamic State. He explained he went to Jordan in part to find like-minded Muslims, and because he wanted to do something “bigger, better, and more purposeful” – like dying in the cause of Allah. But, he said, he was afraid of making his parents sad. In the course of their conversations, Patel discussed his desire to see a holy war between Muslims and non-Muslims. He also sang an Islamic State fight song and recalled making a replica of the group’s flag. He said he wanted to replace his neighbor’s American flag with it. Patel returned to Williamsburg on Sept. 6, 2016. Shortly thereafter, he moved into a motel his parents owned and started applying for jobs with the military, as well as some paramilitary organizations – like police and fire departments, correctional facilities and probation offices. While back in Virginia, Patel stayed in touch with the FBI source. He texted the source on Sept. 23, 2016, and expressed support for Maj. Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 soldiers in 2009 while serving at Fort Hood. In the process, however, he misidentified Hasan as Nidal Hussein and said the shooting happened at Fort Knox in Kentucky. He also said Hasan had died a martyr, though in fact he remains alive on military death row. Court documents show Patel began saying in late 2016 that he did not actually support the Islamic State.
