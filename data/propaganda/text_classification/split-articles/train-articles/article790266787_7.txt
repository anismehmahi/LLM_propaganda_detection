Those surveyed said by 40 percent to 31 percent that the Senate shouldn't vote to approve his nomination, the first time a plurality of Americans have opposed a Supreme Court nominee since polling on the issue began. The case against confirming Kavanaugh may be somewhere between weak and non-existent, but the constant repetition of the unsupported allegations in the Trump-hating media is clearly taking its toll on the nominee. That said, the Senate Judiciary Committee is tentatively scheduled to vote on the nomination Friday at 9:30 a.m.
"If we're ready to vote, we will vote,” Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tweeted Tuesday at 6:46 p.m. “If we aren't ready, we won't.”
Obviously, a lot is riding on the confirmation. “We're watching a period where what we have to understand is this is about raw power," former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Tuesday. "And if the Left can stop Kavanaugh we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime on the Supreme Court." President Trump quoted the nation’s most prominent conservative radio host as he urged GOP senators to get onboard Tuesday:
“Rush Limbaugh to Republicans: ‘You can kiss the MIDTERMS goodbye if you don’t get highly qualified Kavanaugh approved.’”
Trump is right.
