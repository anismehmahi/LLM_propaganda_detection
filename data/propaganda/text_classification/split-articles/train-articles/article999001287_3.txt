Matt Dixon, bureau chief of Politico, tweeted on Wednesday that the Democratic party volunteer call came during Florida’s ballot recount after ballots were allowed to be amended. “We are now doing a recount, so we want to make sure you let your vote be counted,” Dixon quoted from the voicemail. It seems that Democrats may have called absentee voters about supplying them with cure affidavits after the permitted date. It also looks like whoever sent out the cure affidavits physically changed the due date to say Nov. 8, instead of Nov. 6. Bradley McVay, DOS interim general counsel, asked attorneys in Florida to investigate the conflicting dates. “Altering a form in a manner that provides the incorrect date for a voter to cure a defect … imposes a burden on the voter significant enough to frustrate the voter’s ability to vote,” McVay wrote in a letter, sent on Nov. 9 and publicly released on Tuesday. According to DOS officials, they are less concerned with the inaccurate dates, and more concerned with the fact that the cure affidavits appear to have been deliberately altered. State officials turned over the altered forms to federal investigators. Of the many allegations of ballot mishandling in Florida, this is the first that has been referred to the federal government. While Democrats seem to have told voters they could fix ballot errors up to the Thursday after Election Day — these votes could not count. It looks like Democrats may have hurt their own interests by misleading their voters.
