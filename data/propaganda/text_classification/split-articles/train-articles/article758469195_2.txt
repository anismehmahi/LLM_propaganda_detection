That is the same clinical finding doctors treating the Cuba patients at the University of Philadelphia found. The Guangzhou worker started experiencing "a variety of symptoms" starting in late 2017 that lasted through April this year, Nauert said. The worker was sent to the US for further evaluation, she added. In Cuba last year, 24 diplomats and their family members were left with mysterious injuries resembling brain trauma, which were suspected of being caused by a "sonic attack". Ten Canadian diplomats and their relatives also suffered similar illnesses. The still-unexplained incidents sparked a rift in US-Cuban relations, while investigators have chased theories including a sonic attack, an electromagnetic weapon, or a flawed spying device. Symptoms, sounds and sensations reportedly varied dramatically from person to person, according to The Associated Press. Some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some struggle with concentration or common word recall.
