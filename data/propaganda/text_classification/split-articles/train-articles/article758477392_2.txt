The embassy in Beijing said it could not link the case in China to the health issues suffered by its staff in Cuba. In an email to citizens in China, the state department said: "A US government employee in China recently reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure. "The US government is taking these reports seriously and has informed its official staff in China of this event." They added that they are not sure what has caused the employee's symptoms. The US Secretary of Mike Pompeo has said he is concerned about the "serious health incident" that has affected an embassy worker in Guangzhou. China's foreign ministry and national health commission did not immediately respond to questions about the findings, the Associated Press reported. The US reduced its workforce in Havana, Cuba, in 2017 after its personnel and their families reported experiencing a range of health issues. Investigators have drawn theories including that were targeted by sonic attacks, where the symptoms included dizziness, headaches and vomiting. The attacks can sometimes be carried out by emitting "infrasounds", which are low frequency noises that can affect human hearing if they are loud enough. However, Dr Toby Heys told the New Scientist in 2017 that an infrasound attack wouldn't be "very covert" as a "large array of subwoofers" would be needed.
