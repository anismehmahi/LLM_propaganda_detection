Not only that, but the plague has a very short incubation time. Once exposed, some people will die within 24 hours. Experts say the epidemic could still worsen as the death tolls hit 124 and more than 1,300 are left infected. The World Health Organization (WHO) has now issued alarming warnings in nine countries too. “If they are traveling shorter distances and they’re still in the incubation period, and they have the pneumonic (form) then they could spread it to other places,” said Chopra. “We don’t want to have a situation where the disease spreads so fast it sort of gets out of control. Most of the cases in the past have been of the bubonic plague but if you look at this particular outbreak, 70 percent of the cases are pneumonic plague, which is the most deadly form of the disease. If the treatment is not given in a very short period of time these people will end up dying.”
Both forms of the plague can be cured with antibiotics, but getting treatment quickly is the key to survival.
