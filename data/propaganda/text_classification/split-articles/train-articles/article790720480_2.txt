What about Judge Kavanaugh's comfort in being put through the ringer without a shred of evidence, Senator Flake? It's a good thing he'll be leaving the Senate. Perhaps Arizona will put someone in that actually has a spine rather than living up to Senator Flake's name. Why that investigation is needed is unclear since all the people Dr. Christine Ford named to be at the alleged house where the alleged attack took place all categorically denied the attack took place, including Ford's girl friend. The committee also voted against Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and his motion to subpoena Mark Judge before the committee. While Democrats appeared stunned, specifically self-professed sexual assaulter Cory Booker and Kamila Harris, that they were in the minority and couldn't control things despite eight years under the Obama regime where Republicans were subjected to far worse, the vote carried and Kavanaugh will be voted on in the US Senate.
