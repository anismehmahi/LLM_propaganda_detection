“I did not do this back in high school or at any time.”
Kavanaugh’s friend, who has not been identified, did not outright deny the woman’s claims but told the New Yorker he has “no recollection of that.”
The woman says she has had to undergo psychological treatment as a result of the incident. She first approached her congresswoman, Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., about the allegations in July shortly after Trump tapped Kavanaugh to replace outgoing Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Eshoo’s office declined to comment. The woman’s letter was in turn forwarded to Feinstein, D-Calif., who shared it with the FBI and her Democratic committee colleagues on Wednesday night. An FBI official told the New York Daily News on Thursday that the letter has not yet resulted in a criminal investigation. According to Breitbart, on Friday, 65 women from both the Republican and Democrat parties who have known Kavanaugh since high school defended his character and said he has always behaved “honorably” and treaded “women with respect.”
The women also said that Kavanaugh has “stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity.”
“Judge Kavanaugh has denied this allegation and over 60 women – with a broad range of political views – who’ve known him since high school, have sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee vouching for his integrity and respect for women over that time,” says Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network. “This is nothing more than a last-minute attempt at character assassination, and there should no delay in confirming Judge Kavanaugh.”
