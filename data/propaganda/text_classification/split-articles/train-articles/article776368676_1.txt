Trump To Sessions In Series Of Tweets: ‘Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!’

President Donald Trump has taken to Twitter in order to call upon Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the investigation into his alleged Russian collusion. Trump wants the Justice Department to “stop the rigged witch hunt” before it can “stain our country and further.”
In his Twitter post, Trump also blasted the 17 angry Democrats that are doing a conflicted Mueller’s dirty work. ..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2018
“..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bon Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to [sic] USA!” Trump wrote.

The president made his comments in a series of Tweets earlier this morning. “FBI Agent Peter Strzok (on the Mueller team) should have recused himself on day one. He was out to STOP THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP.
