Here’s a catalogue from the Daily Wire:
1. The New Yorker could not find a single witness who could put Kavanaugh at the alleged party. 2. The New York Times could not find a single person who could corroborate Ramirez’s claims. 3. The man accused of egging on Kavanaugh denied Ramirez's allegations and vouched for Kavanaugh’s character. 4. A third person that Ramirez claimed was at the party says she was not there for the alleged incident. 5. Ramirez contacted her former classmates, asking about the incident, and admitted she was not sure that Kavanaugh was the male who exposed himself. 6. A woman who claims she was “best friends” with Ramirez says Ramirez never mentioned the story and initially said her friend's accusations against Kavanaugh might be “politically motivated.”
7. Ramirez, just like Christine Blasey Ford, is a registered Democrat and is dedicated to leftist causes. 8. Ramirez wasn’t even sure her memory was correct — until she spent six days going over it with her Democrat lawyer. 9. Ramirez admits there are holes in her memory due to how much she drank at the party. 10. People who knew Ramirez after her time at Yale say that she never once mentioned the incident — until Kavanaugh's nomination was pending. No law enforcement agency, let alone the FBI, would waste its time with an allegation of a crime decades in the past, and so patently incoherent and lacking in evidence. The “FBI investigation” is another delaying tactic. Ford has finally agreed to testify, set for Thursday for now.
