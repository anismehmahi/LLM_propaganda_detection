An ex-Secret Service agent is claiming that former Vice President Joe Biden engaged in “Weinstein-level” sexual assault and that he would walk around the VP residence late at night completely naked. According to Big League Politics’ Cassandra Fairbanks, a Secret Service agent who spoke on condition of anonymity revealed that Biden “would mess with every single woman or teen,” and that a Christmas get-together at the VP’s house had to be canceled “because Biden would grope all of our wives and girlfriend’s asses.”
In fact, things were so bad that at one point a Secret Service agent almost got into a fight with Biden. Here is more from Paul Joseph Watson…
During one alleged incident in 2009, Biden cupped the breast of a Secret Service agent’s girlfriend during a photo, prompting the agent to shove Biden and almost hit him. The agent was subsequently suspended for a week, according to the source. Men would often stand in front of female agents and Navy women or create false pretenses to have them leave the room just to get them away from Biden, according to the agent. When I am elected to Congress, I am going to make fighting this sort of predatory behavior a top priority. We are supposed to serve as an example to the rest of the world, and instead, we have become a bad joke. Those that have been engaging in this sort of shameful behavior have got to go because we simply are not going to put up with it anymore. Article posted with permission from End of the American Dream
