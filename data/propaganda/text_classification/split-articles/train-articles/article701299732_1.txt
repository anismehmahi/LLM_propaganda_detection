It’s Airborne: Officials Warn That The “Black Death” Plague Could Spread Rapidly

The fears that the “black death” would spread from Madagascar have now taken hold. As nations grapple with the outbreak of the bubonic plague, nine countries are sounding warnings that the disease is spreading rapidly. The deadly plague outbreak that has struck Madagascar’s major cities has yet to “peak” and that could make the spread of this infection into the surrounding regions more likely. Dr. Ashok Chopra, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas, told The Sun Online the crisis in Madagascar had yet to peak. He also sounded the alarm to neighboring countries. Since there are regular flights in and out of Madagascar and this outbreak has so far, been impossible to contain, other nations are now at risk. Speaking from Madagascar, Christine South, head of IFRC’s (International Federation of Red Cross) emergency operations, said: “With anything like this there is a possibility that somebody could be infected and get on a plane. We have done preparedness support to some of the neighboring countries.” Tourists have been warned to stay out of Madagascar until doctors can get the plague under control to prevent its spread. The outbreak is considered a much bigger threat to the region than in previous years because it has taken on its pneumonic form. That means it is airborne and spread by sneezing and coughing.
