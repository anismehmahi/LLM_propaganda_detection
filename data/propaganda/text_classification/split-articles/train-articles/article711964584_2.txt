We planned to bring the Stars and Stripes, as well as British and Danish flags, and participate in Armed Forces Day memorial commemorations at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, where Rigby served. For this, we were banned. When Prime Minister Theresa May, who was the head of the Home Office when she banned us and was thus directly responsible for the ban, threw us under the bus in order to satiate savages who threatened violence, did she really think she or anyone would be safe? Safe by surrender? When did they ever work in the history of humankind? The über-left pol citing the Geller-Spencer ban in the U.K. to ban Trump was inevitable. It’s like the Geller ban on ads on buses and subways in every major American city: the Catholic Church just tried to run ads on buses in Washington, D.C., and discovered that it couldn’t because of the ban on all political ads that was enacted in order to prevent my ads from running. Once you sanction the silencing and persecution of one, inevitably, you’ve sanctioned it for all. It’s open season on the opposition. Who decides what’s good and what’s forbidden in a totalitarian society? The totalitarians. The worldwide howl at Trump’s retweets of videos tweeted out by a British politician is further proof of the Islamization of the West. It speaks to how deeply and far and widely sharia has been normed and accepted by Western elites. The videos in the retweets are authentic and have circulated for years. They’re neither “far-right” nor “Islamophobic”; they’re just factual. Once again the media are blaming the messenger instead of dealing with Islamic violence. Trump didn’t add any rhetoric to his tweets. He retweeted authentic videos.
