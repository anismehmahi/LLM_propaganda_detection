"I hope today ends (the death threats) when people realize that I wasn't in collusion with Paddock -- that I was not in any way, shape or form associated with the horrible crime that he committed," Haig said. Timeline of sales
Haig said he sold 720 rounds of surplus US military tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after Paddock approached him or an associate at gun shows.

He held Friday's news conference to protect his reputation, he and his attorney said. They gave the following timeline:
• Paddock first approached Haig's table at a Las Vegas gun show sometime last year but met another person who was behind the table. • Haig first met Paddock at a subsequent Phoenix gun show, where he was selling ammunition. • Paddock took Haig's business card because the seller didn't have the quantity of trace ammunition that he wanted. • Paddock later called Haig three times to arrange a sale at Haig's home. • In September, Paddock arrived at Haig's home, bought the tracer ammunition and drove away. The ammunition, he said, was:
• 600 rounds of 7.62mm NATO, M62, tracer ammunition, manufactured by the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri. • 120 rounds of 5.56mm M196 tracer ammunition, manufactured by the same plant. He said the 5.56mm rounds were in their original packaging. He did not comment on the 7.62mm rounds' packaging. Before the sale, Paddock told him "that he was going to go out to the desert and put on a light show" with the ammunition -- that he was "going to go out and shoot it at night with friends."
