The Latest: Police identify suspect in 2 officers' shootings By The Associated Press WESTERVILLE, Ohio â€” Feb 10, 2018 Police in Ohio have identified a 30-year-old man as a suspect in the fatal shooting of two police officers in a Columbus suburb, and released reports showing authorities have had several dealings with him, some involving alleged domestic violence. Westerville police late Saturday confirmed that the suspect is Quentin Lamar Smith. Authorities released incident reports showing police had been to his home or had dealings with him several times since 2017. In a Nov. 29 incident, police say his wife, 33-year-old Candace Smith, asked about protection orders because she and Quentin Smith weren't getting along. She accused her husband of threatening to kill her, their daughter and himself. She told police he had a gun. Police say officers Eric Joering and Anthony Morelli were shot around noon after responding to a "potential domestic situation." [More]

A reminder that the Associated Press has an official policy of "not reporting race" when it's not "relevant". I can't think of anything less irrelevant than a black gunman shooting two white cops--after five years of the "Blacks Lives Matter" movement.
