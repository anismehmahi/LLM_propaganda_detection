He praised the rapid response from WHO and Madagascar authorities that helped bring the outbreak under control, but warned that the danger was not over. The larger-than-usual outbreak had helped spread the bacteria that causes the plague more widely. This along with poor sanitation and vector control on Madagascar meant that "when (the plague) comes again it starts from more stock, and the magnitude in the next transmission could be higher than the one that we saw," Tedros said. "That means that Madagascar could be affected more, and not only that, it could even spill over into neighbouring countries and beyond," he warned. Complicating vector control is the fact that the fleas that carry the Yersinia pestis bacteria that causes the plague have proven to be widely resistant to chemicals and insecticides. "That's a dangerous combination," Tedros said.
