“No enactment of man can be considered law unless it conforms to the Law of God.” –William Blackstone, English Common Law
Representatives are to magnify the law, not tear it down; and yet, this is what the biblically illiterate are teaching others to do, submit to the tyrants and resist God, His Church and His Word (Micah 3:5). I ask, are Christians to submit to those who have sanctioned the murder of the innocent in the womb (Exodus 20:13; Proverbs 6:17)? Absolutely not! Are Christians to submit to those who have redefined marriage where a man can now "marry" a man and a woman can now "marry" a woman (Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:24 etc…)? Absolutely not! Submit to those who lie continuously, to them that steal and even kill? Absolutely not! Submit to what God condemns? Yet, this is what the perverse, modern-day, professing Christians are teaching the sheep in the American Church today. It would do you well to now look to the Christ when He said that we are to beware of the leaven of the Pharisee’s (corrupt doctrines of those who claimed to be the children of God), as well as the leaven of Herod (corrupt doctrines of government) (Mark 8:15). If you remember, it was those same people who called for the crucifixion of Christ while crying out “We have no King but Caesar” (John 19:15). Do these that teach such heresy not realize that every apostle, except John, was killed by hostile corrupt civil authorities opposed to their endeavors? Christians throughout history were imprisoned, tortured, or killed by corrupt civil authorities of all stripes for refusing to submit to their various, lawless policies and prohibitions. Did Christian martyrs violate God’s principles of submission to authority? Of course, not. Also, keep in mind that magistrates have limited and defined authority in civil matters.
