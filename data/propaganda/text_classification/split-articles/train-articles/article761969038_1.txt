National Data | May Jobs: We Unveil The New VDAWDI | Articles

A rough patch—or a double-dip recession? Economists are increasingly befuddled at what awaits the once-great U.S. economy. And Wall Street is plainly beginning to panic. Unemployment is a case in point. It now seems obvious that one of those mysterious memos has gone out to the Main Stream Media saying that no-one can mention the immigration moratorium solution. But unemployment is befuddling anyway. Just a few weeks ago professional prognosticators were expecting job growth of 175,000 in May. However, nonfarm payroll growth came in at 54,000 in May, the smallest gain since September, and a fraction of the just lowered consensus forecast (125,000 jobs.) The "other" employment survey, of households rather than businesses, also broadcast mixed signals—at least so far as the prospects for native-born workers are concerned. VDARE.com has long argued that the household survey captures the employment of illegal aliens; additionally, it actually mentions ethnicity. In May, according to the Household Survey, total employment rose by 105,000. Non-Hispanics actually gained ground:
Total employment: up 105,000 (+0.08 percent)
Non-Hispanic employment: up 190,000 (+0.16 percent)
Hispanic employment: down 85,000 (-0.42 percent)
Thus VDAWDI—VDARE.com's American Worker Displacement Index, unveiled in 2004 and still unique—fell to 126.2 in May from April's 127.0 level. This, of course, is atypical statistical noise.
